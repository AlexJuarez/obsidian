The `ngApp` directive\n * designates the **root element** of the application and is typically placed near the root element\n * of the page - e.g. on the `<body>` or `<html>` tags.\n *\n * Only one AngularJS application can be auto-bootstrapped per HTML document. The first `ngApp`\n * found in the document will be used to define the root element to auto-bootstrap as an\n * application. To run multiple applications in an HTML document you must manually bootstrap them using\n * {@link angular.bootstrap} instead. AngularJS applications cannot be nested within each other.\n *\n * You can specify an **AngularJS module** to be used as the root module for the application.  This\n * module will be loaded into the {@link auto.$injector} when the application is bootstrapped. It\n * should contain the application code needed or have dependencies on other modules that will\n * contain the code. See {@link angular.module} for more information.\n *\n * In the example below if the `ngApp` directive were not placed on the `html` element then the\n * document would not be compiled, the `AppController` would not be instantiated and the `{{ a+b }}`\n * would not be resolved to `3`.\n *\n * `ngApp` is the easiest, and most common way to bootstrap an application.\n *\n <example module=\"ngAppDemo\">\n   <file name=\"index.html\">\n   <div ng-controller=\"ngAppDemoController\">\n     I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}\n   </div>\n   </file>\n   <file name=\"script.js\">\n   angular.module('ngAppDemo', []).controller('ngAppDemoController', function($scope) {\n     $scope.a = 1;\n     $scope.b = 2;\n   });\n   </file>\n </example>\n *\n * Using `ngStrictDi`, you would see something like this:\n *\n <example ng-app-included=\"true\">\n   <file name=\"index.html\">\n   <div ng-app=\"ngAppStrictDemo\" ng-strict-di>\n       <div ng-controller=\"GoodController1\">\n           I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}\n\n           <p>This renders because the controller does not fail to\n              instantiate, by using explicit annotation style (see\n              script.js for details)\n           </p>\n       </div>\n\n       <div ng-controller=\"GoodController2\">\n           Name: <input ng-model=\"name\"><br />\n           Hello, {{name}}!\n\n           <p>This renders because the controller does not fail to\n              instantiate, by using explicit annotation style\n              (see script.js for details)\n           </p>\n       </div>\n\n       <div ng-controller=\"BadController\">\n           I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}\n\n           <p>The controller could not be instantiated, due to relying\n              on automatic function annotations (which are disabled in\n              strict mode).

@description\n * Wraps a raw DOM element or HTML string as a [jQuery](http://jquery.com) element.\n *\n * If jQuery is available, `angular.element` is an alias for the\n * [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/) function. If jQuery is not available, `angular.element`\n * delegates to Angular's built-in subset of jQuery, called \"jQuery lite\" or \"jqLite.\"\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-success\">jqLite is a tiny, API-compatible subset of jQuery that allows\n * Angular to manipulate the DOM in a cross-browser compatible way. **jqLite** implements only the most\n * commonly needed functionality with the goal of having a very small footprint.</div>\n *\n * To use `jQuery`, simply ensure it is loaded before the `angular.js` file.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert\">**Note:** all element references in Angular are always wrapped with jQuery or\n * jqLite; they are never raw DOM references.</div>\n *\n * ## Angular's jqLite\n * jqLite provides only the following jQuery methods:\n *\n * - [`addClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/addClass/)\n * - [`after()`](http://api.jquery.com/after/)\n * - [`append()`](http://api.jquery.com/append/)\n * - [`attr()`](http://api.jquery.com/attr/) - Does not support functions as parameters\n * - [`bind()`](http://api.jquery.com/bind/) - Does not support namespaces, selectors or eventData\n * - [`children()`](http://api.jquery.com/children/) - Does not support selectors\n * - [`clone()`](http://api.jquery.com/clone/)\n * - [`contents()`](http://api.jquery.com/contents/)\n * - [`css()`](http://api.jquery.com/css/) - Only retrieves inline-styles, does not call `getComputedStyle()`. As a setter, does not convert numbers to strings or append 'px'.\n * - [`data()`](http://api.jquery.com/data/)\n * - [`detach()`](http://api.jquery.com/detach/)\n * - [`empty()`](http://api.jquery.com/empty/)\n * - [`eq()`](http://api.jquery.com/eq/)\n * - [`find()`](http://api.jquery.com/find/) - Limited to lookups by tag name\n * - [`hasClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/)\n * - [`html()`](http://api.jquery.com/html/)\n * - [`next()`](http://api.jquery.com/next/) - Does not support selectors\n * - [`on()`](http://api.jquery.com/on/) - Does not support namespaces, selectors or eventData\n * - [`off()`](http://api.jquery.com/off/) - Does not support namespaces or selectors\n * - [`one()`](http://api.jquery.com/one/) - Does not support namespaces or selectors\n * - [`parent()`](http://api.jquery.com/parent/) - Does not support selectors\n * - [`prepend()`](http://api.jquery.com/prepend/)\n * - [`prop()`](http://api.jquery.com/prop/)\n * - [`ready()`](http://api.jquery.com/ready/)\n * - [`remove()`](http://api.jquery.com/remove/)\n * - [`removeAttr()`](http://api.jquery.com/removeAttr/)\n * - [`removeClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/)\n * - [`removeData()`](http://api.jquery.com/removeData/)\n * - [`replaceWith()`](http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/)\n * - [`text()`](http://api.jquery.com/text/)\n * - [`toggleClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/)\n * - [`triggerHandler()`](http://api.jquery.com/triggerHandler/) - Passes a dummy event object to handlers.\n * - [`unbind()`](http://api.jquery.com/unbind/) - Does not support namespaces\n * - [`val()`](http://api.jquery.com/val/)\n * - [`wrap()`](http://api.jquery.com/wrap/)\n *\n * ## jQuery/jqLite Extras\n * Angular also provides the following additional methods and events to both jQuery and jqLite:\n *\n * ### Events\n * - `$destroy` - AngularJS intercepts all jqLite/jQuery's DOM destruction apis and fires this event\n *    on all DOM nodes being removed.  This can be used to clean up any 3rd party bindings to the DOM\n *    element before it is removed.\n *\n * ### Methods\n * - `controller(name)` - retrieves the controller of the current element or its parent. By default\n *   retrieves controller associated with the `ngController` directive. If `name` is provided as\n *   camelCase directive name, then the controller for this directive will be retrieved (e.g.\n *   `'ngModel'`).\n * - `injector()` - retrieves the injector of the current element or its parent.\n * - `scope()` - retrieves the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope} of the current\n *   element or its parent. Requires {@link guide/production#disabling-debug-data Debug Data} to\n *   be enabled.\n * - `isolateScope()` - retrieves an isolate {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope} if one is attached directly to the\n *   current element. This getter should be used only on elements that contain a directive which starts a new isolate\n *   scope. Calling `scope()` on this element always returns the original non-isolate scope.\n *   Requires {@link guide/production#disabling-debug-data Debug Data} to be enabled.\n * - `inheritedData()` - same as `data()`, but walks up the DOM until a value is found or the top\n *   parent element is reached.\n *\n * @param {string|DOMElement} element HTML string or DOMElement to be wrapped into jQuery.\n * @returns {Object} jQuery object.\n */\n\nJQLite.expando = 'ng339';\n\nvar jqCache = JQLite.cache = {},\n    jqId = 1,\n    addEventListenerFn = function(element, type, fn) {\n      element.addEventListener(type, fn, false);\n    },\n    removeEventListenerFn = function(element, type, fn) {\n      element.removeEventListener(type, fn, false);\n    };\n\n/*\n * !!!

You can see the default values below.\n * </div>\n *\n * Therefore the above can be simplified as:\n *\n * ```js\n *   var myModule = angular.module(...);\n *\n *   myModule.directive('directiveName', function factory(injectables) {\n *     var directiveDefinitionObject = {\n *       link: function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs) { ... }\n *     };\n *     return directiveDefinitionObject;\n *     // or\n *     // return function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs) { ... }\n *   });\n * ```\n *\n *\n *\n * ### Directive Definition Object\n *\n * The directive definition object provides instructions to the {@link ng.$compile\n * compiler}. The attributes are:\n *\n * #### `multiElement`\n * When this property is set to true, the HTML compiler will collect DOM nodes between\n * nodes with the attributes `directive-name-start` and `directive-name-end`, and group them\n * together as the directive elements. It is recommended that this feature be used on directives\n * which are not strictly behavioural (such as {@link ngClick}), and which\n * do not manipulate or replace child nodes (such as {@link ngInclude}).\n *\n * #### `priority`\n * When there are multiple directives defined on a single DOM element, sometimes it\n * is necessary to specify the order in which the directives are applied. The `priority` is used\n * to sort the directives before their `compile` functions get called. Priority is defined as a\n * number. Directives with greater numerical `priority` are compiled first. Pre-link functions\n * are also run in priority order, but post-link functions are run in reverse order. The order\n * of directives with the same priority is undefined. The default priority is `0`.\n *\n * #### `terminal`\n * If set to true then the current `priority` will be the last set of directives\n * which will execute (any directives at the current priority will still execute\n * as the order of execution on same `priority` is undefined). Note that expressions\n * and other directives used in the directive's template will also be excluded from execution.\n *\n * #### `scope`\n * **If set to `true`,** then a new scope will be created for this directive. If multiple directives on the\n * same element request a new scope, only one new scope is created. The new scope rule does not\n * apply for the root of the template since the root of the template always gets a new scope.\n *\n * **If set to `{}` (object hash),** then a new \"isolate\" scope is created. The 'isolate' scope differs from\n * normal scope in that it does not prototypically inherit from the parent scope. This is useful\n * when creating reusable components, which should not accidentally read or modify data in the\n * parent scope.\n *\n * The 'isolate' scope takes an object hash which defines a set of local scope properties\n * derived from the parent scope. These local properties are useful for aliasing values for\n * templates. Locals definition is a hash of local scope property to its source:\n *\n * * `@` or `@attr` - bind a local scope property to the value of DOM attribute. The result is\n *   always a string since DOM attributes are strings. If no `attr` name is specified  then the\n *   attribute name is assumed to be the same as the local name.\n *   Given `<widget my-attr=\"hello {{name}}\">` and widget definition\n *   of `scope: { localName:'@myAttr' }`, then widget scope property `localName` will reflect\n *   the interpolated value of `hello {{name}}`. As the `name` attribute changes so will the\n *   `localName` property on the widget scope. The `name` is read from the parent scope (not\n *   component scope).\n *\n * * `=` or `=attr` - set up bi-directional binding between a local scope property and the\n *   parent scope property of name defined via the value of the `attr` attribute. If no `attr`\n *   name is specified then the attribute name is assumed to be the same as the local name.\n *   Given `<widget my-attr=\"parentModel\">` and widget definition of\n *   `scope: { localModel:'=myAttr' }`, then widget scope property `localModel` will reflect the\n *   value of `parentModel` on the parent scope. Any changes to `parentModel` will be reflected\n *   in `localModel` and any changes in `localModel` will reflect in `parentModel`. If the parent\n *   scope property doesn't exist, it will throw a NON_ASSIGNABLE_MODEL_EXPRESSION exception. You\n *   can avoid this behavior using `=?` or `=?attr` in order to flag the property as optional. If\n *   you want to shallow watch for changes (i.e. $watchCollection instead of $watch) you can use\n *   `=*` or `=*attr` (`=*?` or `=*?attr` if the property is optional).\n *\n * * `&` or `&attr` - provides a way to execute an expression in the context of the parent scope.\n *   If no `attr` name is specified then the attribute name is assumed to be the same as the\n *   local name. Given `<widget my-attr=\"count = count + value\">` and widget definition of\n *   `scope: { localFn:'&myAttr' }`, then isolate scope property `localFn` will point to\n *   a function wrapper for the `count = count + value` expression. Often it's desirable to\n *   pass data from the isolated scope via an expression to the parent scope, this can be\n *   done by passing a map of local variable names and values into the expression wrapper fn.\n *   For example, if the expression is `increment(amount)` then we can specify the amount value\n *   by calling the `localFn` as `localFn({amount: 22})`.\n *\n *\n * #### `bindToController`\n * When an isolate scope is used for a component (see above), and `controllerAs` is used, `bindToController: true` will\n * allow a component to have its properties bound to the controller, rather than to scope. When the controller\n * is instantiated, the initial values of the isolate scope bindings are already available.\n *\n * #### `controller`\n * Controller constructor function. The controller is instantiated before the\n * pre-linking phase and it is shared with other directives (see\n * `require` attribute). This allows the directives to communicate with each other and augment\n * each other's behavior. The controller is injectable (and supports bracket notation) with the following locals:\n *\n * * `$scope` - Current scope associated with the element\n * * `$element` - Current element\n * * `$attrs` - Current attributes object for the element\n * * `$transclude` - A transclude linking function pre-bound to the correct transclusion scope:\n *   `function([scope], cloneLinkingFn, futureParentElement)`.\n *    * `scope`: optional argument to override the scope.\n *    * `cloneLinkingFn`: optional argument to create clones of the original transcluded content.\n *    * `futureParentElement`:\n *        * defines the parent to which the `cloneLinkingFn` will add the cloned elements.\n *        * default: `$element.parent()` resp. `$element` for `transclude:'element'` resp. `transclude:true`.\n *        * only needed for transcludes that are allowed to contain non html elements (e.g. SVG elements)\n *          and when the `cloneLinkinFn` is passed,\n *          as those elements need to created and cloned in a special way when they are defined outside their\n *          usual containers (e.g. like `<svg>`).\n *        * See also the `directive.templateNamespace` property.\n *\n *\n * #### `require`\n * Require another directive and inject its controller as the fourth argument to the linking function. The\n * `require` takes a string name (or array of strings) of the directive(s) to pass in. If an array is used, the\n * injected argument will be an array in corresponding order. If no such directive can be\n * found, or if the directive does not have a controller, then an error is raised (unless no link function\n * is specified, in which case error checking is skipped). The name can be prefixed with:\n *\n * * (no prefix) - Locate the required controller on the current element. Throw an error if not found.\n * * `?` - Attempt to locate the required controller or pass `null` to the `link` fn if not found.\n * * `^` - Locate the required controller by searching the element and its parents. Throw an error if not found.\n * * `^^` - Locate the required controller by searching the element's parents. Throw an error if not found.\n * * `?^` - Attempt to locate the required controller by searching the element and its parents or pass\n *   `null` to the `link` fn if not found.\n * * `?^^` - Attempt to locate the required controller by searching the element's parents, or pass\n *   `null` to the `link` fn if not found.\n *\n *\n * #### `controllerAs`\n * Identifier name for a reference to the controller in the directive's scope.\n * This allows the controller to be referenced from the directive template. The directive\n * needs to define a scope for this configuration to be used. Useful in the case when\n * directive is used as component.\n *\n *\n * #### `restrict`\n * String of subset of `EACM` which restricts the directive to a specific directive\n * declaration style. If omitted, the defaults (elements and attributes) are used.\n *\n * * `E` - Element name (default): `<my-directive></my-directive>`\n * * `A` - Attribute (default): `<div my-directive=\"exp\"></div>`\n * * `C` - Class: `<div class=\"my-directive: exp;\"></div>`\n * * `M` - Comment: `<!-- directive: my-directive exp -->`\n *\n *\n * #### `templateNamespace`\n * String representing the document type used by the markup in the template.\n * AngularJS needs this information as those elements need to be created and cloned\n * in a special way when they are defined outside their usual containers like `<svg>` and `<math>`.\n *\n * * `html` - All root nodes in the template are HTML. Root nodes may also be\n *   top-level elements such as `<svg>` or `<math>`.\n * * `svg` - The root nodes in the template are SVG elements (excluding `<math>`).\n * * `math` - The root nodes in the template are MathML elements (excluding `<svg>`).\n *\n * If no `templateNamespace` is specified, then the namespace is considered to be `html`.\n *\n * #### `template`\n * HTML markup that may:\n * * Replace the contents of the directive's element (default).\n * * Replace the directive's element itself (if `replace` is true - DEPRECATED).\n * * Wrap the contents of the directive's element (if `transclude` is true).\n *\n * Value may be:\n *\n * * A string. For example `<div red-on-hover>{{delete_str}}</div>`.\n * * A function which takes two arguments `tElement` and `tAttrs` (described in the `compile`\n *   function api below) and returns a string value.\n *\n *\n * #### `templateUrl`\n * This is similar to `template` but the template is loaded from the specified URL, asynchronously.\n *\n * Because template loading is asynchronous the compiler will suspend compilation of directives on that element\n * for later when the template has been resolved.  In the meantime it will continue to compile and link\n * sibling and parent elements as though this element had not contained any directives.\n *\n * The compiler does not suspend the entire compilation to wait for templates to be loaded because this\n * would result in the whole app \"stalling\" until all templates are loaded asynchronously - even in the\n * case when only one deeply nested directive has `templateUrl`.\n *\n * Template loading is asynchronous even if the template has been preloaded into the {@link $templateCache}\n *\n * You can specify `templateUrl` as a string representing the URL or as a function which takes two\n * arguments `tElement` and `tAttrs` (described in the `compile` function api below) and returns\n * a string value representing the url.  In either case, the template URL is passed through {@link\n * $sce#getTrustedResourceUrl $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl}.\n *\n *\n * #### `replace` ([*DEPRECATED*!], will be removed in next major release - i.e. v2.0)\n * specify what the template should replace. Defaults to `false`.\n *\n * * `true` - the template will replace the directive's element.\n * * `false` - the template will replace the contents of the directive's element.\n *\n * The replacement process migrates all of the attributes / classes from the old element to the new\n * one. See the {@link guide/directive#template-expanding-directive\n * Directives Guide} for an example.\n *\n * There are very few scenarios where element replacement is required for the application function,\n * the main one being reusable custom components that are used within SVG contexts\n * (because SVG doesn't work with custom elements in the DOM tree).\n *\n * #### `transclude`\n * Extract the contents of the element where the directive appears and make it available to the directive.\n * The contents are compiled and provided to the directive as a **transclusion function**. See the\n * {@link $compile#transclusion Transclusion} section below.\n *\n * There are two kinds of transclusion depending upon whether you want to transclude just the contents of the\n * directive's element or the entire element:\n *\n * * `true` - transclude the content (i.e. the child nodes) of the directive's element.\n * * `'element'` - transclude the whole of the directive's element including any directives on this\n *   element that defined at a lower priority than this directive. When used, the `template`\n *   property is ignored.\n *\n *\n * #### `compile`\n *\n * ```js\n *   function compile(tElement, tAttrs, transclude) { ... }\n * ```\n *\n * The compile function deals with transforming the template DOM. Since most directives do not do\n * template transformation, it is not used often. The compile function takes the following arguments:\n *\n *   * `tElement` - template element - The element where the directive has been declared. It is\n *     safe to do template transformation on the element and child elements only.\n *\n *   * `tAttrs` - template attributes - Normalized list of attributes declared on this element shared\n *     between all directive compile functions.\n *\n *   * `transclude` -  [*DEPRECATED*!] A transclude linking function: `function(scope, cloneLinkingFn)`\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note:** The template instance and the link instance may be different objects if the template has\n * been cloned. For this reason it is **not** safe to do anything other than DOM transformations that\n * apply to all cloned DOM nodes within the compile function. Specifically, DOM listener registration\n * should be done in a linking function rather than in a compile function.\n * </div>\n\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note:** The compile function cannot handle directives that recursively use themselves in their\n * own templates or compile functions. Compiling these directives results in an infinite loop and a\n * stack overflow errors.\n *\n * This can be avoided by manually using $compile in the postLink function to imperatively compile\n * a directive's template instead of relying on automatic template compilation via `template` or\n * `templateUrl` declaration or manual compilation inside the compile function.\n * </div>\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-danger\">\n * **Note:** The `transclude` function that is passed to the compile function is deprecated, as it\n *   e.g. does not know about the right outer scope. Please use the transclude function that is passed\n *   to the link function instead.\n * </div>\n\n * A compile function can have a return value which can be either a function or an object.\n *\n * * returning a (post-link) function - is equivalent to registering the linking function via the\n *   `link` property of the config object when the compile function is empty.\n *\n * * returning an object with function(s) registered via `pre` and `post` properties - allows you to\n *   control when a linking function should be called during the linking phase. See info about\n *   pre-linking and post-linking functions below.\n *\n *\n * #### `link`\n * This property is used only if the `compile` property is not defined.\n *\n * ```js\n *   function link(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller, transcludeFn) { ... }\n * ```\n *\n * The link function is responsible for registering DOM listeners as well as updating the DOM. It is\n * executed after the template has been cloned. This is where most of the directive logic will be\n * put.\n *\n *   * `scope` - {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope Scope} - The scope to be used by the\n *     directive for registering {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watches}.\n *\n *   * `iElement` - instance element - The element where the directive is to be used. It is safe to\n *     manipulate the children of the element only in `postLink` function since the children have\n *     already been linked.\n *\n *   * `iAttrs` - instance attributes - Normalized list of attributes declared on this element shared\n *     between all directive linking functions.\n *\n *   * `controller` - the directive's required controller instance(s) - Instances are shared\n *     among all directives, which allows the directives to use the controllers as a communication\n *     channel. The exact value depends on the directive's `require` property:\n *       * no controller(s) required: the directive's own controller, or `undefined` if it doesn't have one\n *       * `string`: the controller instance\n *       * `array`: array of controller instances\n *\n *     If a required controller cannot be found, and it is optional, the instance is `null`,\n *     otherwise the {@link error:$compile:ctreq Missing Required Controller} error is thrown.\n *\n *     Note that you can also require the directive's own controller - it will be made available like\n *     like any other controller.\n *\n *   * `transcludeFn` - A transclude linking function pre-bound to the correct transclusion scope.\n *     This is the same as the `$transclude`\n *     parameter of directive controllers, see there for details.\n *     `function([scope], cloneLinkingFn, futureParentElement)`.\n *\n * #### Pre-linking function\n *\n * Executed before the child elements are linked. Not safe to do DOM transformation since the\n * compiler linking function will fail to locate the correct elements for linking.\n *\n * #### Post-linking function\n *\n * Executed after the child elements are linked.\n *\n * Note that child elements that contain `templateUrl` directives will not have been compiled\n * and linked since they are waiting for their template to load asynchronously and their own\n * compilation and linking has been suspended until that occurs.\n *\n * It is safe to do DOM transformation in the post-linking function on elements that are not waiting\n * for their async templates to be resolved.\n *\n *\n * ### Transclusion\n *\n * Transclusion is the process of extracting a collection of DOM element from one part of the DOM and\n * copying them to another part of the DOM, while maintaining their connection to the original AngularJS\n * scope from where they were taken.\n *\n * Transclusion is used (often with {@link ngTransclude}) to insert the\n * original contents of a directive's element into a specified place in the template of the directive.\n * The benefit of transclusion, over simply moving the DOM elements manually, is that the transcluded\n * content has access to the properties on the scope from which it was taken, even if the directive\n * has isolated scope.\n * See the {@link guide/directive#creating-a-directive-that-wraps-other-elements Directives Guide}.\n *\n * This makes it possible for the widget to have private state for its template, while the transcluded\n * content has access to its originating scope.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note:** When testing an element transclude directive you must not place the directive at the root of the\n * DOM fragment that is being compiled. See {@link guide/unit-testing#testing-transclusion-directives\n * Testing Transclusion Directives}.\n * </div>\n *\n * #### Transclusion Functions\n *\n * When a directive requests transclusion, the compiler extracts its contents and provides a **transclusion\n * function** to the directive's `link` function and `controller`. This transclusion function is a special\n * **linking function** that will return the compiled contents linked to a new transclusion scope.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n * If you are just using {@link ngTransclude} then you don't need to worry about this function, since\n * ngTransclude will deal with it for us.\n * </div>\n *\n * If you want to manually control the insertion and removal of the transcluded content in your directive\n * then you must use this transclude function. When you call a transclude function it returns a a jqLite/JQuery\n * object that contains the compiled DOM, which is linked to the correct transclusion scope.\n *\n * When you call a transclusion function you can pass in a **clone attach function**. This function accepts\n * two parameters, `function(clone, scope) { ... }`, where the `clone` is a fresh compiled copy of your transcluded\n * content and the `scope` is the newly created transclusion scope, to which the clone is bound.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n * **Best Practice**: Always provide a `cloneFn` (clone attach function) when you call a translude function\n * since you then get a fresh clone of the original DOM and also have access to the new transclusion scope.\n * </div>\n *\n * It is normal practice to attach your transcluded content (`clone`) to the DOM inside your **clone\n * attach function**:\n *\n * ```js\n * var transcludedContent, transclusionScope;\n *\n * $transclude(function(clone, scope) {\n *   element.append(clone);\n *   transcludedContent = clone;\n *   transclusionScope = scope;\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Later, if you want to remove the transcluded content from your DOM then you should also destroy the\n * associated transclusion scope:\n *\n * ```js\n * transcludedContent.remove();\n * transclusionScope.$destroy();\n * ```\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n * **Best Practice**: if you intend to add and remove transcluded content manually in your directive\n * (by calling the transclude function to get the DOM and calling `element.remove()` to remove it),\n * then you are also responsible for calling `$destroy` on the transclusion scope.\n * </div>\n *\n * The built-in DOM manipulation directives, such as {@link ngIf}, {@link ngSwitch} and {@link ngRepeat}\n * automatically destroy their transluded clones as necessary so you do not need to worry about this if\n * you are simply using {@link ngTransclude} to inject the transclusion into your directive.\n *\n *\n * #### Transclusion Scopes\n *\n * When you call a transclude function it returns a DOM fragment that is pre-bound to a **transclusion\n * scope**. This scope is special, in that it is a child of the directive's scope (and so gets destroyed\n * when the directive's scope gets destroyed) but it inherits the properties of the scope from which it\n * was taken.\n *\n * For example consider a directive that uses transclusion and isolated scope. The DOM hierarchy might look\n * like this:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-app>\n *   <div isolate>\n *     <div transclusion>\n *     </div>\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * The `$parent` scope hierarchy will look like this:\n *\n * ```\n * - $rootScope\n *   - isolate\n *     - transclusion\n * ```\n *\n * but the scopes will inherit prototypically from different scopes to their `$parent`.\n *\n * ```\n * - $rootScope\n *   - transclusion\n * - isolate\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ### Attributes\n *\n * The {@link ng.$compile.directive.Attributes Attributes} object - passed as a parameter in the\n * `link()` or `compile()` functions. It has a variety of uses.\n *\n * accessing *Normalized attribute names:*\n * Directives like 'ngBind' can be expressed in many ways: 'ng:bind', `data-ng-bind`, or 'x-ng-bind'.\n * the attributes object allows for normalized access to\n *   the attributes.\n *\n * * *Directive inter-communication:* All directives share the same instance of the attributes\n *   object which allows the directives to use the attributes object as inter directive\n *   communication.\n *\n * * *Supports interpolation:* Interpolation attributes are assigned to the attribute object\n *   allowing other directives to read the interpolated value.\n *\n * * *Observing interpolated attributes:* Use `$observe` to observe the value changes of attributes\n *   that contain interpolation (e.g. `src=\"{{bar}}\"`). Not only is this very efficient but it's also\n *   the only way to easily get the actual value because during the linking phase the interpolation\n *   hasn't been evaluated yet and so the value is at this time set to `undefined`.\n *\n * ```js\n * function linkingFn(scope, elm, attrs, ctrl) {\n *   // get the attribute value\n *   console.log(attrs.ngModel);\n *\n *   // change the attribute\n *   attrs.$set('ngModel', 'new value');\n *\n *   // observe changes to interpolated attribute\n *   attrs.$observe('ngModel', function(value) {\n *     console.log('ngModel has changed value to ' + value);\n *   });\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ## Example\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note**: Typically directives are registered with `module.directive`. The example below is\n * to illustrate how `$compile` works.\n * </div>\n *\n <example module=\"compileExample\">\n   <file name=\"index.html\">\n    <script>\n      angular.module('compileExample', [], function($compileProvider) {\n        // configure new 'compile' directive by passing a directive\n        // factory function.

Where:\n *\n *  * `scope` - A {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope Scope} to bind to.\n *  * `cloneAttachFn` - If `cloneAttachFn` is provided, then the link function will clone the\n *  `template` and call the `cloneAttachFn` function allowing the caller to attach the\n *  cloned elements to the DOM document at the appropriate place. The `cloneAttachFn` is\n *  called as: <br/> `cloneAttachFn(clonedElement, scope)` where:\n *\n *      * `clonedElement` - is a clone of the original `element` passed into the compiler.\n *      * `scope` - is the current scope with which the linking function is working with.\n *\n *  * `options` - An optional object hash with linking options. If `options` is provided, then the following\n *  keys may be used to control linking behavior:\n *\n *      * `parentBoundTranscludeFn` - the transclude function made available to\n *        directives; if given, it will be passed through to the link functions of\n *        directives found in `element` during compilation.\n *      * `transcludeControllers` - an object hash with keys that map controller names\n *        to controller instances; if given, it will make the controllers\n *        available to directives.\n *      * `futureParentElement` - defines the parent to which the `cloneAttachFn` will add\n *        the cloned elements; only needed for transcludes that are allowed to contain non html\n *        elements (e.g. SVG elements).

It is either the original\n * element passed in, or the clone of the element if the `cloneAttachFn` is provided.\n *\n * After linking the view is not updated until after a call to $digest which typically is done by\n * Angular automatically.\n *\n * If you need access to the bound view, there are two ways to do it:\n *\n * - If you are not asking the linking function to clone the template, create the DOM element(s)\n *   before you send them to the compiler and keep this reference around.\n *   ```js\n *     var element = $compile('<p>{{total}}</p>')(scope);\n *   ```\n *\n * - if on the other hand, you need the element to be cloned, the view reference from the original\n *   example would not point to the clone, but rather to the original template that was cloned. In\n *   this case, you can access the clone via the cloneAttachFn:\n *   ```js\n *     var templateElement = angular.element('<p>{{total}}</p>'),\n *         scope = ....;\n *\n *     var clonedElement = $compile(templateElement)(scope, function(clonedElement, scope) {\n *       //attach the clone to DOM document at the right place\n *     });\n *\n *     //now we have reference to the cloned DOM via `clonedElement`\n *   ```\n *\n *\n * For information on how the compiler works, see the\n * {@link guide/compiler Angular HTML Compiler} section of the Developer Guide.\n */\n\nvar $compileMinErr = minErr('$compile');\n\n/**\n * @ngdoc provider\n * @name $compileProvider\n *\n * @description\n */\n$CompileProvider.$inject = ['$provide', '$$sanitizeUriProvider'];\nfunction $CompileProvider($provide, $$sanitizeUriProvider) {\n  var hasDirectives = {},\n      Suffix = 'Directive',\n      COMMENT_DIRECTIVE_REGEXP = /^\\s*directive\\:\\s*([\\w\\-]+)\\s+(.*)$/,\n      CLASS_DIRECTIVE_REGEXP = /(([\\w\\-]+)(?:\\:([^;]+))?;?)/,\n      ALL_OR_NOTHING_ATTRS = makeMap('ngSrc,ngSrcset,src,srcset'),\n      REQUIRE_PREFIX_REGEXP = /^(?:(\\^\\^?)?(\\?)?(\\^\\^?)?)?/;\n\n  // Ref: http://developers.whatwg.org/webappapis.html#event-handler-idl-attributes\n  // The assumption is that future DOM event attribute names will begin with\n  // 'on' and be composed of only English letters.\n  var EVENT_HANDLER_ATTR_REGEXP = /^(on[a-z]+|formaction)$/;\n\n  function parseIsolateBindings(scope, directiveName, isController) {\n    var LOCAL_REGEXP = /^\\s*([@&]|=(\\*?))(\\??)\\s*(\\w*)\\s*$/;\n\n    var bindings = {};\n\n    forEach(scope, function(definition, scopeName) {\n      var match = definition.match(LOCAL_REGEXP);\n\n      if (!match) {\n        throw $compileMinErr('iscp',\n            \"Invalid {3} for directive '{0}'.\" +\n            \" Definition: {... {1}: '{2}' ...}\",\n            directiveName, scopeName, definition,\n            (isController ? \"controller bindings definition\" :\n            \"isolate scope definition\"));\n      }\n\n      bindings[scopeName] = {\n        mode: match[1][0],\n        collection: match[2] === '*',\n        optional: match[3] === '?',\n        attrName: match[4] || scopeName\n      };\n    });\n\n    return bindings;\n  }\n\n  function parseDirectiveBindings(directive, directiveName) {\n    var bindings = {\n      isolateScope: null,\n      bindToController: null\n    };\n    if (isObject(directive.scope)) {\n      if (directive.bindToController === true) {\n        bindings.bindToController = parseIsolateBindings(directive.scope,\n                                                         directiveName, true);\n        bindings.isolateScope = {};\n      } else {\n        bindings.isolateScope = parseIsolateBindings(directive.scope,\n                                                     directiveName, false);\n      }\n    }\n    if (isObject(directive.bindToController)) {\n      bindings.bindToController =\n          parseIsolateBindings(directive.bindToController, directiveName, true);\n    }\n    if (isObject(bindings.bindToController)) {\n      var controller = directive.controller;\n      var controllerAs = directive.controllerAs;\n      if (!controller) {\n        // There is no controller, there may or may not be a controllerAs property\n        throw $compileMinErr('noctrl',\n              \"Cannot bind to controller without directive '{0}'s controller.\",\n              directiveName);\n      } else if (!identifierForController(controller, controllerAs)) {\n        // There is a controller, but no identifier or controllerAs property\n        throw $compileMinErr('noident',\n              \"Cannot bind to controller without identifier for directive '{0}'.\",\n              directiveName);\n      }\n    }\n    return bindings;\n  }\n\n  function assertValidDirectiveName(name) {\n    var letter = name.charAt(0);\n    if (!letter || letter !== lowercase(letter)) {\n      throw $compileMinErr('baddir', \"Directive name '{0}' is invalid.

While for simple usage patterns this doesn't matter much, for advanced usage\n     * it is important to familiarize yourself with these APIs and the guarantees they provide.\n     *\n     *\n     * ## General usage\n     * The `$http` service is a function which takes a single argument — a configuration object —\n     * that is used to generate an HTTP request and returns  a {@link ng.$q promise}\n     * with two $http specific methods: `success` and `error`.\n     *\n     * ```js\n     *   // Simple GET request example :\n     *   $http.get('/someUrl').\n     *     success(function(data, status, headers, config) {\n     *       // this callback will be called asynchronously\n     *       // when the response is available\n     *     }).\n     *     error(function(data, status, headers, config) {\n     *       // called asynchronously if an error occurs\n     *       // or server returns response with an error status.\n     *     });\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ```js\n     *   // Simple POST request example (passing data) :\n     *   $http.post('/someUrl', {msg:'hello word!'}).\n     *     success(function(data, status, headers, config) {\n     *       // this callback will be called asynchronously\n     *       // when the response is available\n     *     }).\n     *     error(function(data, status, headers, config) {\n     *       // called asynchronously if an error occurs\n     *       // or server returns response with an error status.\n     *     });\n     * ```\n     *\n     *\n     * Since the returned value of calling the $http function is a `promise`, you can also use\n     * the `then` method to register callbacks, and these callbacks will receive a single argument –\n     * an object representing the response. See the API signature and type info below for more\n     * details.\n     *\n     * A response status code between 200 and 299 is considered a success status and\n     * will result in the success callback being called. Note that if the response is a redirect,\n     * XMLHttpRequest will transparently follow it, meaning that the error callback will not be\n     * called for such responses.\n     *\n     * ## Writing Unit Tests that use $http\n     * When unit testing (using {@link ngMock ngMock}), it is necessary to call\n     * {@link ngMock.$httpBackend#flush $httpBackend.flush()} to flush each pending\n     * request using trained responses.\n     *\n     * ```\n     * $httpBackend.expectGET(...);\n     * $http.get(...);\n     * $httpBackend.flush();\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ## Shortcut methods\n     *\n     * Shortcut methods are also available. All shortcut methods require passing in the URL, and\n     * request data must be passed in for POST/PUT requests.\n     *\n     * ```js\n     *   $http.get('/someUrl').success(successCallback);\n     *   $http.post('/someUrl', data).success(successCallback);\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Complete list of shortcut methods:\n     *\n     * - {@link ng.$http#get $http.get}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#head $http.head}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#post $http.post}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#put $http.put}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#delete $http.delete}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#jsonp $http.jsonp}\n     * - {@link ng.$http#patch $http.patch}\n     *\n     *\n     * ## Setting HTTP Headers\n     *\n     * The $http service will automatically add certain HTTP headers to all requests. These defaults\n     * can be fully configured by accessing the `$httpProvider.defaults.headers` configuration\n     * object, which currently contains this default configuration:\n     *\n     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.common` (headers that are common for all requests):\n     *   - `Accept: application/json, text/plain, * / *`\n     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.post`: (header defaults for POST requests)\n     *   - `Content-Type: application/json`\n     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.put` (header defaults for PUT requests)\n     *   - `Content-Type: application/json`\n     *\n     * To add or overwrite these defaults, simply add or remove a property from these configuration\n     * objects. To add headers for an HTTP method other than POST or PUT, simply add a new object\n     * with the lowercased HTTP method name as the key, e.g.\n     * `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.get = { 'My-Header' : 'value' }`.\n     *\n     * The defaults can also be set at runtime via the `$http.defaults` object in the same\n     * fashion. For example:\n     *\n     * ```\n     * module.run(function($http) {\n     *   $http.defaults.headers.common.Authorization = 'Basic YmVlcDpib29w'\n     * });\n     * ```\n     *\n     * In addition, you can supply a `headers` property in the config object passed when\n     * calling `$http(config)`, which overrides the defaults without changing them globally.\n     *\n     * To explicitly remove a header automatically added via $httpProvider.defaults.headers on a per request basis,\n     * Use the `headers` property, setting the desired header to `undefined`. For example:\n     *\n     * ```js\n     * var req = {\n     *  method: 'POST',\n     *  url: 'http://example.com',\n     *  headers: {\n     *    'Content-Type': undefined\n     *  },\n     *  data: { test: 'test' }\n     * }\n     *\n     * $http(req).success(function(){...}).error(function(){...});\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ## Transforming Requests and Responses\n     *\n     * Both requests and responses can be transformed using transformation functions: `transformRequest`\n     * and `transformResponse`. These properties can be a single function that returns\n     * the transformed value (`function(data, headersGetter, status)`) or an array of such transformation functions,\n     * which allows you to `push` or `unshift` a new transformation function into the transformation chain.\n     *\n     * ### Default Transformations\n     *\n     * The `$httpProvider` provider and `$http` service expose `defaults.transformRequest` and\n     * `defaults.transformResponse` properties. If a request does not provide its own transformations\n     * then these will be applied.\n     *\n     * You can augment or replace the default transformations by modifying these properties by adding to or\n     * replacing the array.\n     *\n     * Angular provides the following default transformations:\n     *\n     * Request transformations (`$httpProvider.defaults.transformRequest` and `$http.defaults.transformRequest`):\n     *\n     * - If the `data` property of the request configuration object contains an object, serialize it\n     *   into JSON format.\n     *\n     * Response transformations (`$httpProvider.defaults.transformResponse` and `$http.defaults.transformResponse`):\n     *\n     *  - If XSRF prefix is detected, strip it (see Security Considerations section below).\n     *  - If JSON response is detected, deserialize it using a JSON parser.\n     *\n     *\n     * ### Overriding the Default Transformations Per Request\n     *\n     * If you wish override the request/response transformations only for a single request then provide\n     * `transformRequest` and/or `transformResponse` properties on the configuration object passed\n     * into `$http`.\n     *\n     * Note that if you provide these properties on the config object the default transformations will be\n     * overwritten. If you wish to augment the default transformations then you must include them in your\n     * local transformation array.\n     *\n     * The following code demonstrates adding a new response transformation to be run after the default response\n     * transformations have been run.\n     *\n     * ```js\n     * function appendTransform(defaults, transform) {\n     *\n     *   // We can't guarantee that the default transformation is an array\n     *   defaults = angular.isArray(defaults) ? defaults : [defaults];\n     *\n     *   // Append the new transformation to the defaults\n     *   return defaults.concat(transform);\n     * }\n     *\n     * $http({\n     *   url: '...',\n     *   method: 'GET',\n     *   transformResponse: appendTransform($http.defaults.transformResponse, function(value) {\n     *     return doTransform(value);\n     *   })\n     * });\n     * ```\n     *\n     *\n     * ## Caching\n     *\n     * To enable caching, set the request configuration `cache` property to `true` (to use default\n     * cache) or to a custom cache object (built with {@link ng.$cacheFactory `$cacheFactory`}).\n     * When the cache is enabled, `$http` stores the response from the server in the specified\n     * cache. The next time the same request is made, the response is served from the cache without\n     * sending a request to the server.\n     *\n     * Note that even if the response is served from cache, delivery of the data is asynchronous in\n     * the same way that real requests are.\n     *\n     * If there are multiple GET requests for the same URL that should be cached using the same\n     * cache, but the cache is not populated yet, only one request to the server will be made and\n     * the remaining requests will be fulfilled using the response from the first request.\n     *\n     * You can change the default cache to a new object (built with\n     * {@link ng.$cacheFactory `$cacheFactory`}) by updating the\n     * {@link ng.$http#defaults `$http.defaults.cache`} property. All requests who set\n     * their `cache` property to `true` will now use this cache object.\n     *\n     * If you set the default cache to `false` then only requests that specify their own custom\n     * cache object will be cached.\n     *\n     * ## Interceptors\n     *\n     * Before you start creating interceptors, be sure to understand the\n     * {@link ng.$q $q and deferred/promise APIs}.\n     *\n     * For purposes of global error handling, authentication, or any kind of synchronous or\n     * asynchronous pre-processing of request or postprocessing of responses, it is desirable to be\n     * able to intercept requests before they are handed to the server and\n     * responses before they are handed over to the application code that\n     * initiated these requests. The interceptors leverage the {@link ng.$q\n     * promise APIs} to fulfill this need for both synchronous and asynchronous pre-processing.\n     *\n     * The interceptors are service factories that are registered with the `$httpProvider` by\n     * adding them to the `$httpProvider.interceptors` array. The factory is called and\n     * injected with dependencies (if specified) and returns the interceptor.\n     *\n     * There are two kinds of interceptors (and two kinds of rejection interceptors):\n     *\n     *   * `request`: interceptors get called with a http `config` object. The function is free to\n     *     modify the `config` object or create a new one.

Angular comes\n     * pre-configured with strategies that address these issues, but for this to work backend server\n     * cooperation is required.\n     *\n     * ### JSON Vulnerability Protection\n     *\n     * A [JSON vulnerability](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx)\n     * allows third party website to turn your JSON resource URL into\n     * [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) request under some conditions. To\n     * counter this your server can prefix all JSON requests with following string `\")]}',\\n\"`.\n     * Angular will automatically strip the prefix before processing it as JSON.\n     *\n     * For example if your server needs to return:\n     * ```js\n     * ['one','two']\n     * ```\n     *\n     * which is vulnerable to attack, your server can return:\n     * ```js\n     * )]}',\n     * ['one','two']\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Angular will strip the prefix, before processing the JSON.\n     *\n     *\n     * ### Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF) Protection\n     *\n     * [XSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) is a technique by which\n     * an unauthorized site can gain your user's private data. Angular provides a mechanism\n     * to counter XSRF. When performing XHR requests, the $http service reads a token from a cookie\n     * (by default, `XSRF-TOKEN`) and sets it as an HTTP header (`X-XSRF-TOKEN`). Since only\n     * JavaScript that runs on your domain could read the cookie, your server can be assured that\n     * the XHR came from JavaScript running on your domain. The header will not be set for\n     * cross-domain requests.\n     *\n     * To take advantage of this, your server needs to set a token in a JavaScript readable session\n     * cookie called `XSRF-TOKEN` on the first HTTP GET request. On subsequent XHR requests the\n     * server can verify that the cookie matches `X-XSRF-TOKEN` HTTP header, and therefore be sure\n     * that only JavaScript running on your domain could have sent the request. The token must be\n     * unique for each user and must be verifiable by the server (to prevent the JavaScript from\n     * making up its own tokens). We recommend that the token is a digest of your site's\n     * authentication cookie with a [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography&#41;)\n     * for added security.\n     *\n     * The name of the headers can be specified using the xsrfHeaderName and xsrfCookieName\n     * properties of either $httpProvider.defaults at config-time, $http.defaults at run-time,\n     * or the per-request config object.\n     *\n     * In order to prevent collisions in environments where multiple Angular apps share the\n     * same domain or subdomain, we recommend that each application uses unique cookie name.\n     *\n     *\n     * @param {object} config Object describing the request to be made and how it should be\n     *    processed. The object has following properties:\n     *\n     *    - **method** – `{string}` – HTTP method (e.g. 'GET', 'POST', etc)\n     *    - **url** – `{string}` – Absolute or relative URL of the resource that is being requested.\n     *    - **params** – `{Object.<string|Object>}` – Map of strings or objects which will be serialized\n     *      with the `paramSerializer` and appended as GET parameters.\n     *    - **data** – `{string|Object}` – Data to be sent as the request message data.\n     *    - **headers** – `{Object}` – Map of strings or functions which return strings representing\n     *      HTTP headers to send to the server. If the return value of a function is null, the\n     *      header will not be sent. Functions accept a config object as an argument.\n     *    - **xsrfHeaderName** – `{string}` – Name of HTTP header to populate with the XSRF token.\n     *    - **xsrfCookieName** – `{string}` – Name of cookie containing the XSRF token.\n     *    - **transformRequest** –\n     *      `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` –\n     *      transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http\n     *      request body and headers and returns its transformed (typically serialized) version.\n     *      See {@link ng.$http#overriding-the-default-transformations-per-request\n     *      Overriding the Default Transformations}\n     *    - **transformResponse** –\n     *      `{function(data, headersGetter, status)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter, status)>}` –\n     *      transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http\n     *      response body, headers and status and returns its transformed (typically deserialized) version.\n     *      See {@link ng.$http#overriding-the-default-transformations-per-request\n     *      Overriding the Default TransformationjqLiks}\n     *    - **paramSerializer** - `{string|function(Object<string,string>):string}` - A function used to\n     *      prepare the string representation of request parameters (specified as an object).\n     *      If specified as string, it is interpreted as function registered with the\n     *      {@link $injector $injector}, which means you can create your own serializer\n     *      by registering it as a {@link auto.$provide#service service}.\n     *      The default serializer is the {@link $httpParamSerializer $httpParamSerializer};\n     *      alternatively, you can use the {@link $httpParamSerializerJQLike $httpParamSerializerJQLike}\n     *    - **cache** – `{boolean|Cache}` – If true, a default $http cache will be used to cache the\n     *      GET request, otherwise if a cache instance built with\n     *      {@link ng.$cacheFactory $cacheFactory}, this cache will be used for\n     *      caching.\n     *    - **timeout** – `{number|Promise}` – timeout in milliseconds, or {@link ng.$q promise}\n     *      that should abort the request when resolved.\n     *    - **withCredentials** - `{boolean}` - whether to set the `withCredentials` flag on the\n     *      XHR object. See [requests with credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Requests_with_credentials)\n     *      for more information.\n     *    - **responseType** - `{string}` - see\n     *      [requestType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest#responseType).\n     *\n     * @returns {HttpPromise} Returns a {@link ng.$q promise} object with the\n     *   standard `then` method and two http specific methods: `success` and `error`. The `then`\n     *   method takes two arguments a success and an error callback which will be called with a\n     *   response object. The `success` and `error` methods take a single argument - a function that\n     *   will be called when the request succeeds or fails respectively. The arguments passed into\n     *   these functions are destructured representation of the response object passed into the\n     *   `then` method. The response object has these properties:\n     *\n     *   - **data** – `{string|Object}` – The response body transformed with the transform\n     *     functions.\n     *   - **status** – `{number}` – HTTP status code of the response.\n     *   - **headers** – `{function([headerName])}` – Header getter function.\n     *   - **config** – `{Object}` – The configuration object that was used to generate the request.\n     *   - **statusText** – `{string}` – HTTP status text of the response.\n     *\n     * @property {Array.<Object>} pendingRequests Array of config objects for currently pending\n     *   requests.

Start and end markers\n     * can be escaped by preceding each of their characters with a REVERSE SOLIDUS U+005C (backslash).\n     * It will be rendered as a regular start/end marker, and will not be interpreted as an expression\n     * or binding.\n     *\n     * This enables web-servers to prevent script injection attacks and defacing attacks, to some\n     * degree, while also enabling code examples to work without relying on the\n     * {@link ng.directive:ngNonBindable ngNonBindable} directive.\n     *\n     * **For security purposes, it is strongly encouraged that web servers escape user-supplied data,\n     * replacing angle brackets (&lt;, &gt;) with &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; respectively, and replacing all\n     * interpolation start/end markers with their escaped counterparts.**\n     *\n     * Escaped interpolation markers are only replaced with the actual interpolation markers in rendered\n     * output when the $interpolate service processes the text. So, for HTML elements interpolated\n     * by {@link ng.$compile $compile}, or otherwise interpolated with the `mustHaveExpression` parameter\n     * set to `true`, the interpolated text must contain an unescaped interpolation expression. As such,\n     * this is typically useful only when user-data is used in rendering a template from the server, or\n     * when otherwise untrusted data is used by a directive.\n     *\n     * <example>\n     *  <file name=\"index.html\">\n     *    <div ng-init=\"username='A user'\">\n     *      <p ng-init=\"apptitle='Escaping demo'\">{{apptitle}}: \\{\\{ username = \"defaced value\"; \\}\\}\n     *        </p>\n     *      <p><strong>{{username}}</strong> attempts to inject code which will deface the\n     *        application, but fails to accomplish their task, because the server has correctly\n     *        escaped the interpolation start/end markers with REVERSE SOLIDUS U+005C (backslash)\n     *        characters.</p>\n     *      <p>Instead, the result of the attempted script injection is visible, and can be removed\n     *        from the database by an administrator.</p>\n     *    </div>\n     *  </file>\n     * </example>\n     *\n     * @param {string} text The text with markup to interpolate.\n     * @param {boolean=} mustHaveExpression if set to true then the interpolation string must have\n     *    embedded expression in order to return an interpolation function.

exceptions)\n * when they are done processing.\n *\n * This is an implementation of promises/deferred objects inspired by\n * [Kris Kowal's Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q).\n *\n * $q can be used in two fashions --- one which is more similar to Kris Kowal's Q or jQuery's Deferred\n * implementations, and the other which resembles ES6 promises to some degree.\n *\n * # $q constructor\n *\n * The streamlined ES6 style promise is essentially just using $q as a constructor which takes a `resolver`\n * function as the first argument. This is similar to the native Promise implementation from ES6 Harmony,\n * see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).\n *\n * While the constructor-style use is supported, not all of the supporting methods from ES6 Harmony promises are\n * available yet.\n *\n * It can be used like so:\n *\n * ```js\n *   // for the purpose of this example let's assume that variables `$q` and `okToGreet`\n *   // are available in the current lexical scope (they could have been injected or passed in).\n *\n *   function asyncGreet(name) {\n *     // perform some asynchronous operation, resolve or reject the promise when appropriate.\n *     return $q(function(resolve, reject) {\n *       setTimeout(function() {\n *         if (okToGreet(name)) {\n *           resolve('Hello, ' + name + '!');\n *         } else {\n *           reject('Greeting ' + name + ' is not allowed.');\n *         }\n *       }, 1000);\n *     });\n *   }\n *\n *   var promise = asyncGreet('Robin Hood');\n *   promise.then(function(greeting) {\n *     alert('Success: ' + greeting);\n *   }, function(reason) {\n *     alert('Failed: ' + reason);\n *   });\n * ```\n *\n * Note: progress/notify callbacks are not currently supported via the ES6-style interface.\n *\n * However, the more traditional CommonJS-style usage is still available, and documented below.\n *\n * [The CommonJS Promise proposal](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises) describes a promise as an\n * interface for interacting with an object that represents the result of an action that is\n * performed asynchronously, and may or may not be finished at any given point in time.\n *\n * From the perspective of dealing with error handling, deferred and promise APIs are to\n * asynchronous programming what `try`, `catch` and `throw` keywords are to synchronous programming.\n *\n * ```js\n *   // for the purpose of this example let's assume that variables `$q` and `okToGreet`\n *   // are available in the current lexical scope (they could have been injected or passed in).\n *\n *   function asyncGreet(name) {\n *     var deferred = $q.defer();\n *\n *     setTimeout(function() {\n *       deferred.notify('About to greet ' + name + '.');\n *\n *       if (okToGreet(name)) {\n *         deferred.resolve('Hello, ' + name + '!');\n *       } else {\n *         deferred.reject('Greeting ' + name + ' is not allowed.');\n *       }\n *     }, 1000);\n *\n *     return deferred.promise;\n *   }\n *\n *   var promise = asyncGreet('Robin Hood');\n *   promise.then(function(greeting) {\n *     alert('Success: ' + greeting);\n *   }, function(reason) {\n *     alert('Failed: ' + reason);\n *   }, function(update) {\n *     alert('Got notification: ' + update);\n *   });\n * ```\n *\n * At first it might not be obvious why this extra complexity is worth the trouble. The payoff\n * comes in the way of guarantees that promise and deferred APIs make, see\n * https://github.com/kriskowal/uncommonjs/blob/master/promises/specification.md.\n *\n * Additionally the promise api allows for composition that is very hard to do with the\n * traditional callback ([CPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style)) approach.\n * For more on this please see the [Q documentation](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) especially the\n * section on serial or parallel joining of promises.\n *\n * # The Deferred API\n *\n * A new instance of deferred is constructed by calling `$q.defer()`.\n *\n * The purpose of the deferred object is to expose the associated Promise instance as well as APIs\n * that can be used for signaling the successful or unsuccessful completion, as well as the status\n * of the task.\n *\n * **Methods**\n *\n * - `resolve(value)` – resolves the derived promise with the `value`. If the value is a rejection\n *   constructed via `$q.reject`, the promise will be rejected instead.\n * - `reject(reason)` – rejects the derived promise with the `reason`. This is equivalent to\n *   resolving it with a rejection constructed via `$q.reject`.\n * - `notify(value)` - provides updates on the status of the promise's execution. This may be called\n *   multiple times before the promise is either resolved or rejected.\n *\n * **Properties**\n *\n * - promise – `{Promise}` – promise object associated with this deferred.\n *\n *\n * # The Promise API\n *\n * A new promise instance is created when a deferred instance is created and can be retrieved by\n * calling `deferred.promise`.\n *\n * The purpose of the promise object is to allow for interested parties to get access to the result\n * of the deferred task when it completes.\n *\n * **Methods**\n *\n * - `then(successCallback, errorCallback, notifyCallback)` – regardless of when the promise was or\n *   will be resolved or rejected, `then` calls one of the success or error callbacks asynchronously\n *   as soon as the result is available. The callbacks are called with a single argument: the result\n *   or rejection reason. Additionally, the notify callback may be called zero or more times to\n *   provide a progress indication, before the promise is resolved or rejected.\n *\n *   This method *returns a new promise* which is resolved or rejected via the return value of the\n *   `successCallback`, `errorCallback` (unless that value is a promise, in which case it is resolved\n *   with the value which is resolved in that promise using\n *   [promise chaining](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/#toc-promises-queues)).\n *   It also notifies via the return value of the `notifyCallback` method. The promise cannot be\n *   resolved or rejected from the notifyCallback method.\n *\n * - `catch(errorCallback)` – shorthand for `promise.then(null, errorCallback)`\n *\n * - `finally(callback, notifyCallback)` – allows you to observe either the fulfillment or rejection of a promise,\n *   but to do so without modifying the final value. This is useful to release resources or do some\n *   clean-up that needs to be done whether the promise was rejected or resolved. See the [full\n *   specification](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#promisefinallycallback) for\n *   more information.\n *\n * # Chaining promises\n *\n * Because calling the `then` method of a promise returns a new derived promise, it is easily\n * possible to create a chain of promises:\n *\n * ```js\n *   promiseB = promiseA.then(function(result) {\n *     return result + 1;\n *   });\n *\n *   // promiseB will be resolved immediately after promiseA is resolved and its value\n *   // will be the result of promiseA incremented by 1\n * ```\n *\n * It is possible to create chains of any length and since a promise can be resolved with another\n * promise (which will defer its resolution further), it is possible to pause/defer resolution of\n * the promises at any point in the chain. This makes it possible to implement powerful APIs like\n * $http's response interceptors.\n *\n *\n * # Differences between Kris Kowal's Q and $q\n *\n *  There are two main differences:\n *\n * - $q is integrated with the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope} Scope model observation\n *   mechanism in angular, which means faster propagation of resolution or rejection into your\n *   models and avoiding unnecessary browser repaints, which would result in flickering UI.\n * - Q has many more features than $q, but that comes at a cost of bytes. $q is tiny, but contains\n *   all the important functionality needed for common async tasks.\n *\n *  # Testing\n *\n *  ```js\n *    it('should simulate promise', inject(function($q, $rootScope) {\n *      var deferred = $q.defer();\n *      var promise = deferred.promise;\n *      var resolvedValue;\n *\n *      promise.then(function(value) { resolvedValue = value; });\n *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();\n *\n *      // Simulate resolving of promise\n *      deferred.resolve(123);\n *      // Note that the 'then' function does not get called synchronously.\n *      // This is because we want the promise API to always be async, whether or not\n *      // it got called synchronously or asynchronously.\n *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();\n *\n *      // Propagate promise resolution to 'then' functions using $apply().\n *      $rootScope.$apply();\n *      expect(resolvedValue).toEqual(123);\n *    }));\n *  ```\n *\n * @param {function(function, function)} resolver Function which is responsible for resolving or\n *   rejecting the newly created promise.

This function will throw `'Maximum iteration limit exceeded.'` if the number of\n       * iterations exceeds 10.\n       *\n       * Usually, you don't call `$digest()` directly in\n       * {@link ng.directive:ngController controllers} or in\n       * {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directives}.\n       * Instead, you should call {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$apply $apply()} (typically from within\n       * a {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directive}), which will force a `$digest()`.\n       *\n       * If you want to be notified whenever `$digest()` is called,\n       * you can register a `watchExpression` function with\n       * {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch $watch()} with no `listener`.\n       *\n       * In unit tests, you may need to call `$digest()` to simulate the scope life cycle.\n       *\n       * # Example\n       * ```js\n           var scope = ...;\n           scope.name = 'misko';\n           scope.counter = 0;\n\n           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(0);\n           scope.$watch('name', function(newValue, oldValue) {\n             scope.counter = scope.counter + 1;\n           });\n           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(0);\n\n           scope.$digest();\n           // the listener is always called during the first $digest loop after it was registered\n           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(1);\n\n           scope.$digest();\n           // but now it will not be called unless the value changes\n           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(1);\n\n           scope.name = 'adam';\n           scope.$digest();\n           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(2);\n       * ```\n       *\n       */\n      $digest: function() {\n        var watch, value, last,\n            watchers,\n            length,\n            dirty, ttl = TTL,\n            next, current, target = this,\n            watchLog = [],\n            logIdx, logMsg, asyncTask;\n\n        beginPhase('$digest');\n        // Check for changes to browser url that happened in sync before the call to $digest\n        $browser.$$checkUrlChange();\n\n        if (this === $rootScope && applyAsyncId !== null) {\n          // If this is the root scope, and $applyAsync has scheduled a deferred $apply(), then\n          // cancel the scheduled $apply and flush the queue of expressions to be evaluated.\n          $browser.defer.cancel(applyAsyncId);\n          flushApplyAsync();\n        }\n\n        lastDirtyWatch = null;\n\n        do { // \"while dirty\" loop\n          dirty = false;\n          current = target;\n\n          while (asyncQueue.length) {\n            try {\n              asyncTask = asyncQueue.shift();\n              asyncTask.scope.$eval(asyncTask.expression, asyncTask.locals);\n            } catch (e) {\n              $exceptionHandler(e);\n            }\n            lastDirtyWatch = null;\n          }\n\n          traverseScopesLoop:\n          do { // \"traverse the scopes\" loop\n            if ((watchers = current.$$watchers)) {\n              // process our watches\n              length = watchers.length;\n              while (length--) {\n                try {\n                  watch = watchers[length];\n                  // Most common watches are on primitives, in which case we can short\n                  // circuit it with === operator, only when === fails do we use .equals\n                  if (watch) {\n                    if ((value = watch.get(current)) !== (last = watch.last) &&\n                        !(watch.eq\n                            ? equals(value, last)\n                            : (typeof value === 'number' && typeof last === 'number'\n                               && isNaN(value) && isNaN(last)))) {\n                      dirty = true;\n                      lastDirtyWatch = watch;\n                      watch.last = watch.eq ? copy(value, null) : value;\n                      watch.fn(value, ((last === initWatchVal) ? value : last), current);\n                      if (ttl < 5) {\n                        logIdx = 4 - ttl;\n                        if (!watchLog[logIdx]) watchLog[logIdx] = [];\n                        watchLog[logIdx].push({\n                          msg: isFunction(watch.exp) ?

One example of\n * such a context is binding arbitrary html controlled by the user via `ng-bind-html`.  We refer\n * to these contexts as privileged or SCE contexts.\n *\n * As of version 1.2, Angular ships with SCE enabled by default.\n *\n * Note:  When enabled (the default), IE<11 in quirks mode is not supported.  In this mode, IE<11 allow\n * one to execute arbitrary javascript by the use of the expression() syntax.  Refer\n * <http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/10/16/ending-expressions.aspx> to learn more about them.\n * You can ensure your document is in standards mode and not quirks mode by adding `<!doctype html>`\n * to the top of your HTML document.\n *\n * SCE assists in writing code in way that (a) is secure by default and (b) makes auditing for\n * security vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking, etc. a lot easier.\n *\n * Here's an example of a binding in a privileged context:\n *\n * ```\n * <input ng-model=\"userHtml\" aria-label=\"User input\">\n * <div ng-bind-html=\"userHtml\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that `ng-bind-html` is bound to `userHtml` controlled by the user.  With SCE\n * disabled, this application allows the user to render arbitrary HTML into the DIV.\n * In a more realistic example, one may be rendering user comments, blog articles, etc. via\n * bindings.  (HTML is just one example of a context where rendering user controlled input creates\n * security vulnerabilities.)\n *\n * For the case of HTML, you might use a library, either on the client side, or on the server side,\n * to sanitize unsafe HTML before binding to the value and rendering it in the document.\n *\n * How would you ensure that every place that used these types of bindings was bound to a value that\n * was sanitized by your library (or returned as safe for rendering by your server?)  How can you\n * ensure that you didn't accidentally delete the line that sanitized the value, or renamed some\n * properties/fields and forgot to update the binding to the sanitized value?\n *\n * To be secure by default, you want to ensure that any such bindings are disallowed unless you can\n * determine that something explicitly says it's safe to use a value for binding in that\n * context.  You can then audit your code (a simple grep would do) to ensure that this is only done\n * for those values that you can easily tell are safe - because they were received from your server,\n * sanitized by your library, etc.  You can organize your codebase to help with this - perhaps\n * allowing only the files in a specific directory to do this.  Ensuring that the internal API\n * exposed by that code doesn't markup arbitrary values as safe then becomes a more manageable task.\n *\n * In the case of AngularJS' SCE service, one uses {@link ng.$sce#trustAs $sce.trustAs}\n * (and shorthand methods such as {@link ng.$sce#trustAsHtml $sce.trustAsHtml}, etc.) to\n * obtain values that will be accepted by SCE / privileged contexts.\n *\n *\n * ## How does it work?\n *\n * In privileged contexts, directives and code will bind to the result of {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted\n * $sce.getTrusted(context, value)} rather than to the value directly.  Directives use {@link\n * ng.$sce#parseAs $sce.parseAs} rather than `$parse` to watch attribute bindings, which performs the\n * {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted} behind the scenes on non-constant literals.\n *\n * As an example, {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} uses {@link\n * ng.$sce#parseAsHtml $sce.parseAsHtml(binding expression)}.  Here's the actual code (slightly\n * simplified):\n *\n * ```\n * var ngBindHtmlDirective = ['$sce', function($sce) {\n *   return function(scope, element, attr) {\n *     scope.$watch($sce.parseAsHtml(attr.ngBindHtml), function(value) {\n *       element.html(value || '');\n *     });\n *   };\n * }];\n * ```\n *\n * ## Impact on loading templates\n *\n * This applies both to the {@link ng.directive:ngInclude `ng-include`} directive as well as\n * `templateUrl`'s specified by {@link guide/directive directives}.\n *\n * By default, Angular only loads templates from the same domain and protocol as the application\n * document.  This is done by calling {@link ng.$sce#getTrustedResourceUrl\n * $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl} on the template URL.  To load templates from other domains and/or\n * protocols, you may either either {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelist\n * them} or {@link ng.$sce#trustAsResourceUrl wrap it} into a trusted value.\n *\n * *Please note*:\n * The browser's\n * [Same Origin Policy](https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_XMLHttpRequest)\n * and [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)\n * policy apply in addition to this and may further restrict whether the template is successfully\n * loaded.  This means that without the right CORS policy, loading templates from a different domain\n * won't work on all browsers.  Also, loading templates from `file://` URL does not work on some\n * browsers.\n *\n * ## This feels like too much overhead\n *\n * It's important to remember that SCE only applies to interpolation expressions.\n *\n * If your expressions are constant literals, they're automatically trusted and you don't need to\n * call `$sce.trustAs` on them (remember to include the `ngSanitize` module) (e.g.\n * `<div ng-bind-html=\"'<b>implicitly trusted</b>'\"></div>`) just works.\n *\n * Additionally, `a[href]` and `img[src]` automatically sanitize their URLs and do not pass them\n * through {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted}.  SCE doesn't play a role here.\n *\n * The included {@link ng.$sceDelegate $sceDelegate} comes with sane defaults to allow you to load\n * templates in `ng-include` from your application's domain without having to even know about SCE.\n * It blocks loading templates from other domains or loading templates over http from an https\n * served document.  You can change these by setting your own custom {@link\n * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelists} and {@link\n * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist blacklists} for matching such URLs.\n *\n * This significantly reduces the overhead.  It is far easier to pay the small overhead and have an\n * application that's secure and can be audited to verify that with much more ease than bolting\n * security onto an application later.\n *\n * <a name=\"contexts\"></a>\n * ## What trusted context types are supported?\n *\n * | Context             | Notes          |\n * |---------------------|----------------|\n * | `$sce.HTML`         | For HTML that's safe to source into the application.  The {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} directive uses this context for bindings. If an unsafe value is encountered and the {@link ngSanitize $sanitize} module is present this will sanitize the value instead of throwing an error. |\n * | `$sce.CSS`          | For CSS that's safe to source into the application.  Currently unused.  Feel free to use it in your own directives. |\n * | `$sce.URL`          | For URLs that are safe to follow as links.  Currently unused (`<a href=` and `<img src=` sanitize their urls and don't constitute an SCE context. |\n * | `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` | For URLs that are not only safe to follow as links, but whose contents are also safe to include in your application.  Examples include `ng-include`, `src` / `ngSrc` bindings for tags other than `IMG` (e.g. `IFRAME`, `OBJECT`, etc.)  <br><br>Note that `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` makes a stronger statement about the URL than `$sce.URL` does and therefore contexts requiring values trusted for `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` can be used anywhere that values trusted for `$sce.URL` are required. |\n * | `$sce.JS`           | For JavaScript that is safe to execute in your application's context.  Currently unused.  Feel free to use it in your own directives. |\n *\n * ## Format of items in {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist resourceUrlWhitelist}/{@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist Blacklist} <a name=\"resourceUrlPatternItem\"></a>\n *\n *  Each element in these arrays must be one of the following:\n *\n *  - **'self'**\n *    - The special **string**, `'self'`, can be used to match against all URLs of the **same\n *      domain** as the application document using the **same protocol**.\n *  - **String** (except the special value `'self'`)\n *    - The string is matched against the full *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource\n *      being tested (substring matches are not good enough.)\n *    - There are exactly **two wildcard sequences** - `*` and `**`.  All other characters\n *      match themselves.\n *    - `*`: matches zero or more occurrences of any character other than one of the following 6\n *      characters: '`:`', '`/`', '`.`', '`?`', '`&`' and ';'.  It's a useful wildcard for use\n *      in a whitelist.\n *    - `**`: matches zero or more occurrences of *any* character.  As such, it's not\n *      not appropriate to use in for a scheme, domain, etc. as it would match too much.  (e.g.\n *      http://**.example.com/ would match http://evil.com/?ignore=.example.com/ and that might\n *      not have been the intention.)  Its usage at the very end of the path is ok.  (e.g.\n *      http://foo.example.com/templates/**).\n *  - **RegExp** (*see caveat below*)\n *    - *Caveat*:  While regular expressions are powerful and offer great flexibility,  their syntax\n *      (and all the inevitable escaping) makes them *harder to maintain*.  It's easy to\n *      accidentally introduce a bug when one updates a complex expression (imho, all regexes should\n *      have good test coverage.).  For instance, the use of `.` in the regex is correct only in a\n *      small number of cases.  A `.` character in the regex used when matching the scheme or a\n *      subdomain could be matched against a `:` or literal `.` that was likely not intended.   It\n *      is highly recommended to use the string patterns and only fall back to regular expressions\n *      if they as a last resort.\n *    - The regular expression must be an instance of RegExp (i.e. not a string.)  It is\n *      matched against the **entire** *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource being tested\n *      (even when the RegExp did not have the `^` and `$` codes.)  In addition, any flags\n *      present on the RegExp (such as multiline, global, ignoreCase) are ignored.\n *    - If you are generating your JavaScript from some other templating engine (not\n *      recommended, e.g. in issue [#4006](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/4006)),\n *      remember to escape your regular expression (and be aware that you might need more than\n *      one level of escaping depending on your templating engine and the way you interpolated\n *      the value.)  Do make use of your platform's escaping mechanism as it might be good\n *      enough before coding your own.  e.g. Ruby has\n *      [Regexp.escape(str)](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Regexp.html#method-c-escape)\n *      and Python has [re.escape](http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.escape).\n *      Javascript lacks a similar built in function for escaping.  Take a look at Google\n *      Closure library's [goog.string.regExpEscape(s)](\n *      http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/closure_goog_string_string.js.source.html#line962).\n *\n * Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} for an example.\n *\n * ## Show me an example using SCE.\n *\n * <example module=\"mySceApp\" deps=\"angular-sanitize.js\">\n * <file name=\"index.html\">\n *   <div ng-controller=\"AppController as myCtrl\">\n *     <i ng-bind-html=\"myCtrl.explicitlyTrustedHtml\" id=\"explicitlyTrustedHtml\"></i><br><br>\n *     <b>User comments</b><br>\n *     By default, HTML that isn't explicitly trusted (e.g. Alice's comment) is sanitized when\n *     $sanitize is available.

It must return an object that will be accepted by\n   *     getTrusted() for a compatible contextEnum and return this value.\n   *\n   * - valueOf(value)\n   *     For values that were not produced by trustAs(), return them as is.  For values that were\n   *     produced by trustAs(), return the corresponding input value to trustAs.  Basically, if\n   *     trustAs is wrapping the given values into some type, this operation unwraps it when given\n   *     such a value.\n   *\n   * - getTrusted(contextEnum, value)\n   *     This function should return the a value that is safe to use in the context specified by\n   *     contextEnum or throw and exception otherwise.\n   *\n   * NOTE: This contract deliberately does NOT state that values returned by trustAs() must be\n   * opaque or wrapped in some holder object.

Normalizing means that a relative\n * URL will be resolved into an absolute URL in the context of the application document.\n * Parsing means that the anchor node's host, hostname, protocol, port, pathname and related\n * properties are all populated to reflect the normalized URL.  This approach has wide\n * compatibility - Safari 1+, Mozilla 1+, Opera 7+,e etc.  See\n * http://www.aptana.com/reference/html/api/HTMLAnchorElement.html\n *\n * Implementation Notes for IE\n * ---------------------------\n * IE >= 8 and <= 10 normalizes the URL when assigned to the anchor node similar to the other\n * browsers.  However, the parsed components will not be set if the URL assigned did not specify\n * them.  (e.g. if you assign a.href = \"foo\", then a.protocol, a.host, etc. will be empty.)  We\n * work around that by performing the parsing in a 2nd step by taking a previously normalized\n * URL (e.g. by assigning to a.href) and assigning it a.href again.  This correctly populates the\n * properties such as protocol, hostname, port, etc.\n *\n * IE7 does not normalize the URL when assigned to an anchor node.  (Apparently, it does, if one\n * uses the inner HTML approach to assign the URL as part of an HTML snippet -\n * http://stackoverflow.com/a/472729)  However, setting img[src] does normalize the URL.\n * Unfortunately, setting img[src] to something like \"javascript:foo\" on IE throws an exception.\n * Since the primary usage for normalizing URLs is to sanitize such URLs, we can't use that\n * method and IE < 8 is unsupported.\n *\n * References:\n *   http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement\n *   http://www.aptana.com/reference/html/api/HTMLAnchorElement.html\n *   http://url.spec.whatwg.org/#urlutils\n *   https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/2902\n *   http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/parsing-urls-with-the-dom/\n *\n * @kind function\n * @param {string} url The URL to be parsed.\n * @description Normalizes and parses a URL.\n * @returns {object} Returns the normalized URL as a dictionary.\n *\n *   | member name   | Description    |\n *   |---------------|----------------|\n *   | href          | A normalized version of the provided URL if it was not an absolute URL |\n *   | protocol      | The protocol including the trailing colon                              |\n *   | host          | The host and port (if the port is non-default) of the normalizedUrl    |\n *   | search        | The search params, minus the question mark                             |\n *   | hash          | The hash string, minus the hash symbol\n *   | hostname      | The hostname\n *   | port          | The port, without \":\"\n *   | pathname      | The pathname, beginning with \"/\"\n *\n */\nfunction urlResolve(url) {\n  var href = url;\n\n  if (msie) {\n    // Normalize before parse.

A special\n *     property name `$` can be used (as in `{$:\"text\"}`) to accept a match against any\n *     property of the object or its nested object properties. That's equivalent to the simple\n *     substring match with a `string` as described above. The predicate can be negated by prefixing\n *     the string with `!`.\n *     For example `{name: \"!M\"}` predicate will return an array of items which have property `name`\n *     not containing \"M\".\n *\n *     Note that a named property will match properties on the same level only, while the special\n *     `$` property will match properties on the same level or deeper. E.g. an array item like\n *     `{name: {first: 'John', last: 'Doe'}}` will **not** be matched by `{name: 'John'}`, but\n *     **will** be matched by `{$: 'John'}`.\n *\n *   - `function(value, index, array)`: A predicate function can be used to write arbitrary filters.\n *     The function is called for each element of the array, with the element, its index, and\n *     the entire array itself as arguments.\n *\n *     The final result is an array of those elements that the predicate returned true for.\n *\n * @param {function(actual, expected)|true|undefined} comparator Comparator which is used in\n *     determining if the expected value (from the filter expression) and actual value (from\n *     the object in the array) should be considered a match.\n *\n *   Can be one of:\n *\n *   - `function(actual, expected)`:\n *     The function will be given the object value and the predicate value to compare and\n *     should return true if both values should be considered equal.\n *\n *   - `true`: A shorthand for `function(actual, expected) { return angular.equals(actual, expected)}`.\n *     This is essentially strict comparison of expected and actual.\n *\n *   - `false|undefined`: A short hand for a function which will look for a substring match in case\n *     insensitive way.\n *\n *     Primitive values are converted to strings. Objects are not compared against primitives,\n *     unless they have a custom `toString` method (e.g. `Date` objects).\n *\n * @example\n   <example>\n     <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <div ng-init=\"friends = [{name:'John', phone:'555-1276'},\n                                {name:'Mary', phone:'800-BIG-MARY'},\n                                {name:'Mike', phone:'555-4321'},\n                                {name:'Adam', phone:'555-5678'},\n                                {name:'Julie', phone:'555-8765'},\n                                {name:'Juliette', phone:'555-5678'}]\"></div>\n\n       <label>Search: <input ng-model=\"searchText\"></label>\n       <table id=\"searchTextResults\">\n         <tr><th>Name</th><th>Phone</th></tr>\n         <tr ng-repeat=\"friend in friends | filter:searchText\">\n           <td>{{friend.name}}</td>\n           <td>{{friend.phone}}</td>\n         </tr>\n       </table>\n       <hr>\n       <label>Any: <input ng-model=\"search.$\"></label> <br>\n       <label>Name only <input ng-model=\"search.name\"></label><br>\n       <label>Phone only <input ng-model=\"search.phone\"></label><br>\n       <label>Equality <input type=\"checkbox\" ng-model=\"strict\"></label><br>\n       <table id=\"searchObjResults\">\n         <tr><th>Name</th><th>Phone</th></tr>\n         <tr ng-repeat=\"friendObj in friends | filter:search:strict\">\n           <td>{{friendObj.name}}</td>\n           <td>{{friendObj.phone}}</td>\n         </tr>\n       </table>\n     </file>\n     <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n       var expectFriendNames = function(expectedNames, key) {\n         element.all(by.repeater(key + ' in friends').column(key + '.name')).then(function(arr) {\n           arr.forEach(function(wd, i) {\n             expect(wd.getText()).toMatch(expectedNames[i]);\n           });\n         });\n       };\n\n       it('should search across all fields when filtering with a string', function() {\n         var searchText = element(by.model('searchText'));\n         searchText.clear();\n         searchText.sendKeys('m');\n         expectFriendNames(['Mary', 'Mike', 'Adam'], 'friend');\n\n         searchText.clear();\n         searchText.sendKeys('76');\n         expectFriendNames(['John', 'Julie'], 'friend');\n       });\n\n       it('should search in specific fields when filtering with a predicate object', function() {\n         var searchAny = element(by.model('search.$'));\n         searchAny.clear();\n         searchAny.sendKeys('i');\n         expectFriendNames(['Mary', 'Mike', 'Julie', 'Juliette'], 'friendObj');\n       });\n       it('should use a equal comparison when comparator is true', function() {\n         var searchName = element(by.model('search.name'));\n         var strict = element(by.model('strict'));\n         searchName.clear();\n         searchName.sendKeys('Julie');\n         strict.click();\n         expectFriendNames(['Julie'], 'friendObj');\n       });\n     </file>\n   </example>\n */\nfunction filterFilter() {\n  return function(array, expression, comparator) {\n    if (!isArrayLike(array)) {\n      if (array == null) {\n        return array;\n      } else {\n        throw minErr('filter')('notarray', 'Expected array but received: {0}', array);\n      }\n    }\n\n    var expressionType = getTypeForFilter(expression);\n    var predicateFn;\n    var matchAgainstAnyProp;\n\n    switch (expressionType) {\n      case 'function':\n        predicateFn = expression;\n        break;\n      case 'boolean':\n      case 'null':\n      case 'number':\n      case 'string':\n        matchAgainstAnyProp = true;\n        //jshint -W086\n      case 'object':\n        //jshint +W086\n        predicateFn = createPredicateFn(expression, comparator, matchAgainstAnyProp);\n        break;\n      default:\n        return array;\n    }\n\n    return Array.prototype.filter.call(array, predicateFn);\n  };\n}\n\nfunction hasCustomToString(obj) {\n  return isFunction(obj.toString) && obj.toString !== Object.prototype.toString;\n}\n\n// Helper functions for `filterFilter`\nfunction createPredicateFn(expression, comparator, matchAgainstAnyProp) {\n  var shouldMatchPrimitives = isObject(expression) && ('$' in expression);\n  var predicateFn;\n\n  if (comparator === true) {\n    comparator = equals;\n  } else if (!isFunction(comparator)) {\n    comparator = function(actual, expected) {\n      if (isUndefined(actual)) {\n        // No substring matching against `undefined`\n        return false;\n      }\n      if ((actual === null) || (expected === null)) {\n        // No substring matching against `null`;

The first predicate in the array\n *      is used for sorting, but when two items are equivalent, the next predicate is used.\n *\n *    If the predicate is missing or empty then it defaults to `'+'`.\n *\n * @param {boolean=} reverse Reverse the order of the array.\n * @returns {Array} Sorted copy of the source array.\n *\n *\n * @example\n * The example below demonstrates a simple ngRepeat, where the data is sorted\n * by age in descending order (predicate is set to `'-age'`).\n * `reverse` is not set, which means it defaults to `false`.\n   <example module=\"orderByExample\">\n     <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <script>\n         angular.module('orderByExample', [])\n           .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n             $scope.friends =\n                 [{name:'John', phone:'555-1212', age:10},\n                  {name:'Mary', phone:'555-9876', age:19},\n                  {name:'Mike', phone:'555-4321', age:21},\n                  {name:'Adam', phone:'555-5678', age:35},\n                  {name:'Julie', phone:'555-8765', age:29}];\n           }]);\n       </script>\n       <div ng-controller=\"ExampleController\">\n         <table class=\"friend\">\n           <tr>\n             <th>Name</th>\n             <th>Phone Number</th>\n             <th>Age</th>\n           </tr>\n           <tr ng-repeat=\"friend in friends | orderBy:'-age'\">\n             <td>{{friend.name}}</td>\n             <td>{{friend.phone}}</td>\n             <td>{{friend.age}}</td>\n           </tr>\n         </table>\n       </div>\n     </file>\n   </example>\n *\n * The predicate and reverse parameters can be controlled dynamically through scope properties,\n * as shown in the next example.\n * @example\n   <example module=\"orderByExample\">\n     <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <script>\n         angular.module('orderByExample', [])\n           .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n             $scope.friends =\n                 [{name:'John', phone:'555-1212', age:10},\n                  {name:'Mary', phone:'555-9876', age:19},\n                  {name:'Mike', phone:'555-4321', age:21},\n                  {name:'Adam', phone:'555-5678', age:35},\n                  {name:'Julie', phone:'555-8765', age:29}];\n             $scope.predicate = 'age';\n             $scope.reverse = true;\n             $scope.order = function(predicate) {\n               $scope.reverse = ($scope.predicate === predicate) ?

This means that the outer form is valid when all of the child\n * forms are valid as well. However, browsers do not allow nesting of `<form>` elements, so\n * Angular provides the {@link ng.directive:ngForm `ngForm`} directive which behaves identically to\n * `<form>` but can be nested.  This allows you to have nested forms, which is very useful when\n * using Angular validation directives in forms that are dynamically generated using the\n * {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat `ngRepeat`} directive. Since you cannot dynamically generate the `name`\n * attribute of input elements using interpolation, you have to wrap each set of repeated inputs in an\n * `ngForm` directive and nest these in an outer `form` element.\n *\n *\n * # CSS classes\n *  - `ng-valid` is set if the form is valid.\n *  - `ng-invalid` is set if the form is invalid.\n *  - `ng-pristine` is set if the form is pristine.\n *  - `ng-dirty` is set if the form is dirty.\n *  - `ng-submitted` is set if the form was submitted.\n *\n * Keep in mind that ngAnimate can detect each of these classes when added and removed.\n *\n *\n * # Submitting a form and preventing the default action\n *\n * Since the role of forms in client-side Angular applications is different than in classical\n * roundtrip apps, it is desirable for the browser not to translate the form submission into a full\n * page reload that sends the data to the server. Instead some javascript logic should be triggered\n * to handle the form submission in an application-specific way.\n *\n * For this reason, Angular prevents the default action (form submission to the server) unless the\n * `<form>` element has an `action` attribute specified.\n *\n * You can use one of the following two ways to specify what javascript method should be called when\n * a form is submitted:\n *\n * - {@link ng.directive:ngSubmit ngSubmit} directive on the form element\n * - {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick} directive on the first\n  *  button or input field of type submit (input[type=submit])\n *\n * To prevent double execution of the handler, use only one of the {@link ng.directive:ngSubmit ngSubmit}\n * or {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick} directives.\n * This is because of the following form submission rules in the HTML specification:\n *\n * - If a form has only one input field then hitting enter in this field triggers form submit\n * (`ngSubmit`)\n * - if a form has 2+ input fields and no buttons or input[type=submit] then hitting enter\n * doesn't trigger submit\n * - if a form has one or more input fields and one or more buttons or input[type=submit] then\n * hitting enter in any of the input fields will trigger the click handler on the *first* button or\n * input[type=submit] (`ngClick`) *and* a submit handler on the enclosing form (`ngSubmit`)\n *\n * Any pending `ngModelOptions` changes will take place immediately when an enclosing form is\n * submitted. Note that `ngClick` events will occur before the model is updated. Use `ngSubmit`\n * to have access to the updated model.\n *\n * ## Animation Hooks\n *\n * Animations in ngForm are triggered when any of the associated CSS classes are added and removed.\n * These classes are: `.ng-pristine`, `.ng-dirty`, `.ng-invalid` and `.ng-valid` as well as any\n * other validations that are performed within the form. Animations in ngForm are similar to how\n * they work in ngClass and animations can be hooked into using CSS transitions, keyframes as well\n * as JS animations.\n *\n * The following example shows a simple way to utilize CSS transitions to style a form element\n * that has been rendered as invalid after it has been validated:\n *\n * <pre>\n * //be sure to include ngAnimate as a module to hook into more\n * //advanced animations\n * .my-form {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n *   background: white;\n * }\n * .my-form.ng-invalid {\n *   background: red;\n *   color:white;\n * }\n * </pre>\n *\n * @example\n    <example deps=\"angular-animate.js\" animations=\"true\" fixBase=\"true\" module=\"formExample\">\n      <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <script>\n         angular.module('formExample', [])\n           .controller('FormController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n             $scope.userType = 'guest';\n           }]);\n       </script>\n       <style>\n        .my-form {\n          -webkit-transition:all linear 0.5s;\n          transition:all linear 0.5s;\n          background: transparent;\n        }\n        .my-form.ng-invalid {\n          background: red;\n        }\n       </style>\n       <form name=\"myForm\" ng-controller=\"FormController\" class=\"my-form\">\n         userType: <input name=\"input\" ng-model=\"userType\" required>\n         <span class=\"error\" ng-show=\"myForm.input.$error.required\">Required!</span><br>\n         <code>userType = {{userType}}</code><br>\n         <code>myForm.input.$valid = {{myForm.input.$valid}}</code><br>\n         <code>myForm.input.$error = {{myForm.input.$error}}</code><br>\n         <code>myForm.$valid = {{myForm.$valid}}</code><br>\n         <code>myForm.$error.required = {{!!myForm.$error.required}}</code><br>\n        </form>\n      </file>\n      <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n        it('should initialize to model', function() {\n          var userType = element(by.binding('userType'));\n          var valid = element(by.binding('myForm.input.$valid'));\n\n          expect(userType.getText()).toContain('guest');\n          expect(valid.getText()).toContain('true');\n        });\n\n        it('should be invalid if empty', function() {\n          var userType = element(by.binding('userType'));\n          var valid = element(by.binding('myForm.input.$valid'));\n          var userInput = element(by.model('userType'));\n\n          userInput.clear();\n          userInput.sendKeys('');\n\n          expect(userType.getText()).toEqual('userType =');\n          expect(valid.getText()).toContain('false');\n        });\n      </file>\n    </example>\n *\n * @param {string=} name Name of the form.

an HTML element by databinding\n * an expression that represents all classes to be added.\n *\n * The directive operates in three different ways, depending on which of three types the expression\n * evaluates to:\n *\n * 1. If the expression evaluates to a string, the string should be one or more space-delimited class\n * names.\n *\n * 2. If the expression evaluates to an object, then for each key-value pair of the\n * object with a truthy value the corresponding key is used as a class name.\n *\n * 3. If the expression evaluates to an array, each element of the array should either be a string as in\n * type 1 or an object as in type 2. This means that you can mix strings and objects together in an array\n * to give you more control over what CSS classes appear.

ngClass and pre-existing CSS3 Transitions/Animations\n   The ngClass directive still supports CSS3 Transitions/Animations even if they do not follow the ngAnimate CSS naming structure.\n   Upon animation ngAnimate will apply supplementary CSS classes to track the start and end of an animation, but this will not hinder\n   any pre-existing CSS transitions already on the element. To get an idea of what happens during a class-based animation, be sure\n   to view the step by step details of {@link $animate#addClass $animate.addClass} and\n   {@link $animate#removeClass $animate.removeClass}.\n */\nvar ngClassDirective = classDirective('', true);\n\n/**\n * @ngdoc directive\n * @name ngClassOdd\n * @restrict AC\n *\n * @description\n * The `ngClassOdd` and `ngClassEven` directives work exactly as\n * {@link ng.directive:ngClass ngClass}, except they work in\n * conjunction with `ngRepeat` and take effect only on odd (even) rows.\n *\n * This directive can be applied only within the scope of an\n * {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat ngRepeat}.\n *\n * @element ANY\n * @param {expression} ngClassOdd {@link guide/expression Expression} to eval.

This is a key aspect of how angular\n * supports the principles behind the Model-View-Controller design pattern.\n *\n * MVC components in angular:\n *\n * * Model — Models are the properties of a scope; scopes are attached to the DOM where scope properties\n *   are accessed through bindings.\n * * View — The template (HTML with data bindings) that is rendered into the View.\n * * Controller — The `ngController` directive specifies a Controller class; the class contains business\n *   logic behind the application to decorate the scope with functions and values\n *\n * Note that you can also attach controllers to the DOM by declaring it in a route definition\n * via the {@link ngRoute.$route $route} service. A common mistake is to declare the controller\n * again using `ng-controller` in the template itself.  This will cause the controller to be attached\n * and executed twice.\n *\n * @element ANY\n * @scope\n * @priority 500\n * @param {expression} ngController Name of a constructor function registered with the current\n * {@link ng.$controllerProvider $controllerProvider} or an {@link guide/expression expression}\n * that on the current scope evaluates to a constructor function.\n *\n * The controller instance can be published into a scope property by specifying\n * `ng-controller=\"as propertyName\"`.\n *\n * If the current `$controllerProvider` is configured to use globals (via\n * {@link ng.$controllerProvider#allowGlobals `$controllerProvider.allowGlobals()` }), this may\n * also be the name of a globally accessible constructor function (not recommended).\n *\n * @example\n * Here is a simple form for editing user contact information. Adding, removing, clearing, and\n * greeting are methods declared on the controller (see source tab). These methods can\n * easily be called from the angular markup. Any changes to the data are automatically reflected\n * in the View without the need for a manual update.\n *\n * Two different declaration styles are included below:\n *\n * * one binds methods and properties directly onto the controller using `this`:\n * `ng-controller=\"SettingsController1 as settings\"`\n * * one injects `$scope` into the controller:\n * `ng-controller=\"SettingsController2\"`\n *\n * The second option is more common in the Angular community, and is generally used in boilerplates\n * and in this guide. However, there are advantages to binding properties directly to the controller\n * and avoiding scope.\n *\n * * Using `controller as` makes it obvious which controller you are accessing in the template when\n * multiple controllers apply to an element.\n * * If you are writing your controllers as classes you have easier access to the properties and\n * methods, which will appear on the scope, from inside the controller code.\n * * Since there is always a `.` in the bindings, you don't have to worry about prototypal\n * inheritance masking primitives.\n *\n * This example demonstrates the `controller as` syntax.\n *\n * <example name=\"ngControllerAs\" module=\"controllerAsExample\">\n *   <file name=\"index.html\">\n *    <div id=\"ctrl-as-exmpl\"

This\n * autodetection however triggers a CSP error to be logged in the console:\n *\n * ```\n * Refused to evaluate a string as JavaScript because 'unsafe-eval' is not an allowed source of\n * script in the following Content Security Policy directive: \"default-src 'self'\". Note that\n * 'script-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.\n * ```\n *\n * This error is harmless but annoying. To prevent the error from showing up, put the `ngCsp`\n * directive on the root element of the application or on the `angular.js` script tag, whichever\n * appears first in the html document.\n *\n * *Note: This directive is only available in the `ng-csp` and `data-ng-csp` attribute form.*\n *\n * @example\n * This example shows how to apply the `ngCsp` directive to the `html` tag.\n   ```html\n

If the expression assigned to `ngIf` evaluates to a false\n * value then the element is removed from the DOM, otherwise a clone of the\n * element is reinserted into the DOM.\n *\n * `ngIf` differs from `ngShow` and `ngHide` in that `ngIf` completely removes and recreates the\n * element in the DOM rather than changing its visibility via the `display` css property.  A common\n * case when this difference is significant is when using css selectors that rely on an element's\n * position within the DOM, such as the `:first-child` or `:last-child` pseudo-classes.\n *\n * Note that when an element is removed using `ngIf` its scope is destroyed and a new scope\n * is created when the element is restored.  The scope created within `ngIf` inherits from\n * its parent scope using\n * [prototypal inheritance](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes#javascript-prototypal-inheritance).\n * An important implication of this is if `ngModel` is used within `ngIf` to bind to\n * a javascript primitive defined in the parent scope. In this case any modifications made to the\n * variable within the child scope will override (hide) the value in the parent scope.\n *\n * Also, `ngIf` recreates elements using their compiled state. An example of this behavior\n * is if an element's class attribute is directly modified after it's compiled, using something like\n * jQuery's `.addClass()` method, and the element is later removed. When `ngIf` recreates the element\n * the added class will be lost because the original compiled state is used to regenerate the element.\n *\n * Additionally, you can provide animations via the `ngAnimate` module to animate the `enter`\n * and `leave` effects.\n *\n * @animations\n * enter - happens just after the `ngIf` contents change and a new DOM element is created and injected into the `ngIf` container\n * leave - happens just before the `ngIf` contents are removed from the DOM\n *\n * @element ANY\n * @scope\n * @priority 600\n * @param {expression} ngIf If the {@link guide/expression expression} is falsy then\n *     the element is removed from the DOM tree.

It purposefully does not contain any logic which deals with DOM rendering or\n * listening to DOM events.\n * Such DOM related logic should be provided by other directives which make use of\n * `NgModelController` for data-binding to control elements.\n * Angular provides this DOM logic for most {@link input `input`} elements.\n * At the end of this page you can find a {@link ngModel.NgModelController#custom-control-example\n * custom control example} that uses `ngModelController` to bind to `contenteditable` elements.\n *\n * @example\n * ### Custom Control Example\n * This example shows how to use `NgModelController` with a custom control to achieve\n * data-binding. Notice how different directives (`contenteditable`, `ng-model`, and `required`)\n * collaborate together to achieve the desired result.\n *\n * `contenteditable` is an HTML5 attribute, which tells the browser to let the element\n * contents be edited in place by the user.\n *\n * We are using the {@link ng.service:$sce $sce} service here and include the {@link ngSanitize $sanitize}\n * module to automatically remove \"bad\" content like inline event listener (e.g. `<span onclick=\"...\">`).\n * However, as we are using `$sce` the model can still decide to provide unsafe content if it marks\n * that content using the `$sce` service.\n *\n * <example name=\"NgModelController\" module=\"customControl\" deps=\"angular-sanitize.js\">\n    <file name=\"style.css\">\n      [contenteditable] {\n        border: 1px solid black;\n        background-color: white;\n        min-height: 20px;\n      }\n\n      .ng-invalid {\n        border: 1px solid red;\n      }\n\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"script.js\">\n      angular.module('customControl', ['ngSanitize']).\n        directive('contenteditable', ['$sce', function($sce) {\n          return {\n            restrict: 'A', // only activate on element attribute\n            require: '?ngModel', // get a hold of NgModelController\n            link: function(scope, element, attrs, ngModel) {\n              if (!ngModel) return;

If the property doesn't already exist on this scope, it will be created\n * implicitly and added to the scope.\n *\n * For best practices on using `ngModel`, see:\n *\n *  - [Understanding Scopes](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes)\n *\n * For basic examples, how to use `ngModel`, see:\n *\n *  - {@link ng.directive:input input}\n *    - {@link input[text] text}\n *    - {@link input[checkbox] checkbox}\n *    - {@link input[radio] radio}\n *    - {@link input[number] number}\n *    - {@link input[email] email}\n *    - {@link input[url] url}\n *    - {@link input[date] date}\n *    - {@link input[datetime-local] datetime-local}\n *    - {@link input[time] time}\n *    - {@link input[month] month}\n *    - {@link input[week] week}\n *  - {@link ng.directive:select select}\n *  - {@link ng.directive:textarea textarea}\n *\n * # CSS classes\n * The following CSS classes are added and removed on the associated input/select/textarea element\n * depending on the validity of the model.\n *\n *  - `ng-valid`: the model is valid\n *  - `ng-invalid`: the model is invalid\n *  - `ng-valid-[key]`: for each valid key added by `$setValidity`\n *  - `ng-invalid-[key]`: for each invalid key added by `$setValidity`\n *  - `ng-pristine`: the control hasn't been interacted with yet\n *  - `ng-dirty`: the control has been interacted with\n *  - `ng-touched`: the control has been blurred\n *  - `ng-untouched`: the control hasn't been blurred\n *  - `ng-pending`: any `$asyncValidators` are unfulfilled\n *\n * Keep in mind that ngAnimate can detect each of these classes when added and removed.\n *\n * ## Animation Hooks\n *\n * Animations within models are triggered when any of the associated CSS classes are added and removed\n * on the input element which is attached to the model. These classes are: `.ng-pristine`, `.ng-dirty`,\n * `.ng-invalid` and `.ng-valid` as well as any other validations that are performed on the model itself.\n * The animations that are triggered within ngModel are similar to how they work in ngClass and\n * animations can be hooked into using CSS transitions, keyframes as well as JS animations.\n *\n * The following example shows a simple way to utilize CSS transitions to style an input element\n * that has been rendered as invalid after it has been validated:\n *\n * <pre>\n * //be sure to include ngAnimate as a module to hook into more\n * //advanced animations\n * .my-input {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n *   background: white;\n * }\n * .my-input.ng-invalid {\n *   background: red;\n *   color:white;\n * }\n * </pre>\n *\n * @example\n * <example deps=\"angular-animate.js\" animations=\"true\" fixBase=\"true\" module=\"inputExample\">\n     <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <script>\n        angular.module('inputExample', [])\n          .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n            $scope.val = '1';\n          }]);\n       </script>\n       <style>\n         .my-input {\n           -webkit-transition:all linear 0.5s;\n           transition:all linear 0.5s;\n           background: transparent;\n         }\n         .my-input.ng-invalid {\n           color:white;\n           background: red;\n         }\n       </style>\n       <p id=\"inputDescription\">\n        Update input to see transitions when valid/invalid.\n        Integer is a valid value.\n       </p>\n       <form name=\"testForm\" ng-controller=\"ExampleController\">\n         <input ng-model=\"val\" ng-pattern=\"/^\\d+$/\" name=\"anim\" class=\"my-input\"\n                aria-describedby=\"inputDescription\" />\n       </form>\n     </file>\n * </example>\n *\n * ## Binding to a getter/setter\n *\n * Sometimes it's helpful to bind `ngModel` to a getter/setter function.  A getter/setter is a\n * function that returns a representation of the model when called with zero arguments, and sets\n * the internal state of a model when called with an argument. It's sometimes useful to use this\n * for models that have an internal representation that's different from what the model exposes\n * to the view.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n * **Best Practice:** It's best to keep getters fast because Angular is likely to call them more\n * frequently than other parts of your code.\n * </div>\n *\n * You use this behavior by adding `ng-model-options=\"{ getterSetter: true }\"` to an element that\n * has `ng-model` attached to it. You can also add `ng-model-options=\"{ getterSetter: true }\"` to\n * a `<form>`, which will enable this behavior for all `<input>`s within it. See\n * {@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions `ngModelOptions`} for more.\n *\n * The following example shows how to use `ngModel` with a getter/setter:\n *\n * @example\n * <example name=\"ngModel-getter-setter\" module=\"getterSetterExample\">\n     <file name=\"index.html\">\n       <div ng-controller=\"ExampleController\">\n         <form name=\"userForm\">\n           <label>Name:\n             <input type=\"text\" name=\"userName\"\n                    ng-model=\"user.name\"\n                    ng-model-options=\"{ getterSetter: true }\" />\n           </label>\n         </form>\n         <pre>user.name = <span ng-bind=\"user.name()\"></span></pre>\n       </div>\n     </file>\n     <file name=\"app.js\">\n       angular.module('getterSetterExample', [])\n         .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n           var _name = 'Brian';\n           $scope.user = {\n             name: function(newName) {\n              // Note that newName can be undefined for two reasons:\n              // 1.

Using `ngModelOptions` you can specify a custom list of\n * events that will trigger a model update and/or a debouncing delay so that the actual update only\n * takes place when a timer expires; this timer will be reset after another change takes place.\n *\n * Given the nature of `ngModelOptions`, the value displayed inside input fields in the view might\n * be different from the value in the actual model. This means that if you update the model you\n * should also invoke {@link ngModel.NgModelController `$rollbackViewValue`} on the relevant input field in\n * order to make sure it is synchronized with the model and that any debounced action is canceled.\n *\n * The easiest way to reference the control's {@link ngModel.NgModelController `$rollbackViewValue`}\n * method is by making sure the input is placed inside a form that has a `name` attribute. This is\n * important because `form` controllers are published to the related scope under the name in their\n * `name` attribute.\n *\n * Any pending changes will take place immediately when an enclosing form is submitted via the\n * `submit` event. Note that `ngClick` events will occur before the model is updated. Use `ngSubmit`\n * to have access to the updated model.\n *\n * `ngModelOptions` has an effect on the element it's declared on and its descendants.\n *\n * @param {Object} ngModelOptions options to apply to the current model. Valid keys are:\n *   - `updateOn`: string specifying which event should the input be bound to. You can set several\n *     events using an space delimited list. There is a special event called `default` that\n *     matches the default events belonging of the control.\n *   - `debounce`: integer value which contains the debounce model update value in milliseconds. A\n *     value of 0 triggers an immediate update. If an object is supplied instead, you can specify a\n *     custom value for each event. For example:\n *     `ng-model-options=\"{ updateOn: 'default blur', debounce: { 'default': 500, 'blur': 0 } }\"`\n *   - `allowInvalid`: boolean value which indicates that the model can be set with values that did\n *     not validate correctly instead of the default behavior of setting the model to undefined.\n *   - `getterSetter`: boolean value which determines whether or not to treat functions bound to\n       `ngModel` as getters/setters.\n *   - `timezone`: Defines the timezone to be used to read/write the `Date` instance in the model for\n *     `<input type=\"date\">`, `<input type=\"time\">`, ... . It understands UTC/GMT and the\n *     continental US time zone abbreviations, but for general use, use a time zone offset, for\n *     example, `'+0430'` (4 hours, 30 minutes east of the Greenwich meridian)\n *     If not specified, the timezone of the browser will be used.\n *\n * @example\n\n  The following example shows how to override immediate updates. Changes on the inputs within the\n  form will update the model only when the control loses focus (blur event). If `escape` key is\n  pressed while the input field is focused, the value is reset to the value in the current model.\n\n  <example name=\"ngModelOptions-directive-blur\" module=\"optionsExample\">\n    <file name=\"index.html\">\n      <div ng-controller=\"ExampleController\">\n        <form name=\"userForm\">\n          <label>Name:\n            <input type=\"text\" name=\"userName\"\n                   ng-model=\"user.name\"\n                   ng-model-options=\"{ updateOn: 'blur' }\"\n                   ng-keyup=\"cancel($event)\" />\n          </label><br />\n          <label>Other data:\n            <input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"user.data\" />\n          </label><br />\n        </form>\n        <pre>user.name = <span ng-bind=\"user.name\"></span></pre>\n      </div>\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"app.js\">\n      angular.module('optionsExample', [])\n        .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n          $scope.user = { name: 'say', data: '' };\n\n          $scope.cancel = function(e) {\n            if (e.keyCode == 27) {\n              $scope.userForm.userName.$rollbackViewValue();\n            }\n          };\n        }]);\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n      var model = element(by.binding('user.name'));\n      var input = element(by.model('user.name'));\n      var other = element(by.model('user.data'));\n\n      it('should allow custom events', function() {\n        input.sendKeys(' hello');\n        input.click();\n        expect(model.getText()).toEqual('say');\n        other.click();\n        expect(model.getText()).toEqual('say hello');\n      });\n\n      it('should $rollbackViewValue when model changes', function() {\n        input.sendKeys(' hello');\n        expect(input.getAttribute('value')).toEqual('say hello');\n        input.sendKeys(protractor.Key.ESCAPE);\n        expect(input.getAttribute('value')).toEqual('say');\n        other.click();\n        expect(model.getText()).toEqual('say');\n      });\n    </file>\n  </example>\n\n  This one shows how to debounce model changes.

However, `ngOptions` provides some benefits such as reducing memory and\n * increasing speed by not creating a new scope for each repeated instance, as well as providing\n * more flexibility in how the `<select>`'s model is assigned via the `select` **`as`** part of the\n * comprehension expression. `ngOptions` should be used when the `<select>` model needs to be bound\n *  to a non-string value. This is because an option element can only be bound to string values at\n * present.\n *\n * When an item in the `<select>` menu is selected, the array element or object property\n * represented by the selected option will be bound to the model identified by the `ngModel`\n * directive.\n *\n * Optionally, a single hard-coded `<option>` element, with the value set to an empty string, can\n * be nested into the `<select>` element. This element will then represent the `null` or \"not selected\"\n * option. See example below for demonstration.\n *\n * ## Complex Models (objects or collections)\n *\n * **Note:** By default, `ngModel` watches the model by reference, not value. This is important when\n * binding any input directive to a model that is an object or a collection.\n *\n * Since this is a common situation for `ngOptions` the directive additionally watches the model using\n * `$watchCollection` when the select has the `multiple` attribute or when there is a `track by` clause in\n * the options expression. This allows ngOptions to trigger a re-rendering of the options even if the actual\n * object/collection has not changed identity but only a property on the object or an item in the collection\n * changes.\n *\n * Note that `$watchCollection` does a shallow comparison of the properties of the object (or the items in the collection\n * if the model is an array). This means that changing a property deeper inside the object/collection that the\n * first level will not trigger a re-rendering.\n *\n *\n * ## `select` **`as`**\n *\n * Using `select` **`as`** will bind the result of the `select` expression to the model, but\n * the value of the `<select>` and `<option>` html elements will be either the index (for array data sources)\n * or property name (for object data sources) of the value within the collection. If a **`track by`** expression\n * is used, the result of that expression will be set as the value of the `option` and `select` elements.\n *\n *\n * ### `select` **`as`** and **`track by`**\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * Do not use `select` **`as`** and **`track by`** in the same expression. They are not designed to work together.\n * </div>\n *\n * Consider the following example:\n *\n * ```html\n * <select ng-options=\"item.subItem as item.label for item in values track by item.id\" ng-model=\"selected\">\n * ```\n *\n * ```js\n * $scope.values = [{\n *   id: 1,\n *   label: 'aLabel',\n *   subItem: { name: 'aSubItem' }\n * }, {\n *   id: 2,\n *   label: 'bLabel',\n *   subItem: { name: 'bSubItem' }\n * }];\n *\n * $scope.selected = { name: 'aSubItem' };\n * ```\n *\n * With the purpose of preserving the selection, the **`track by`** expression is always applied to the element\n * of the data source (to `item` in this example). To calculate whether an element is selected, we do the\n * following:\n *\n * 1. Apply **`track by`** to the elements in the array. In the example: `[1, 2]`\n * 2. Apply **`track by`** to the already selected value in `ngModel`.\n *    In the example: this is not possible as **`track by`** refers to `item.id`, but the selected\n *    value from `ngModel` is `{name: 'aSubItem'}`, so the **`track by`** expression is applied to\n *    a wrong object, the selected element can't be found, `<select>` is always reset to the \"not\n *    selected\" option.\n *\n *\n * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.\n * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.\n * @param {string=} required The control is considered valid only if value is entered.\n * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds `required` attribute and `required` validation constraint to\n *    the element when the ngRequired expression evaluates to true.

that displays messages according to en-US localization rules.\n * These rules are bundled with angular.js, but can be overridden\n * (see {@link guide/i18n Angular i18n} dev guide). You configure ngPluralize directive\n * by specifying the mappings between\n * [plural categories](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)\n * and the strings to be displayed.\n *\n * # Plural categories and explicit number rules\n * There are two\n * [plural categories](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)\n * in Angular's default en-US locale: \"one\" and \"other\".\n *\n * While a plural category may match many numbers (for example, in en-US locale, \"other\" can match\n * any number that is not 1), an explicit number rule can only match one number. For example, the\n * explicit number rule for \"3\" matches the number 3. There are examples of plural categories\n * and explicit number rules throughout the rest of this documentation.\n *\n * # Configuring ngPluralize\n * You configure ngPluralize by providing 2 attributes: `count` and `when`.\n * You can also provide an optional attribute, `offset`.\n *\n * The value of the `count` attribute can be either a string or an {@link guide/expression\n * Angular expression}; these are evaluated on the current scope for its bound value.\n *\n * The `when` attribute specifies the mappings between plural categories and the actual\n * string to be displayed. The value of the attribute should be a JSON object.\n *\n * The following example shows how to configure ngPluralize:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ng-pluralize count=\"personCount\"\n                 when=\"{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',\n *                      'one': '1 person is viewing.',\n *                      'other': '{} people are viewing.'}\">\n * </ng-pluralize>\n *```\n *\n * In the example, `\"0: Nobody is viewing.\"` is an explicit number rule. If you did not\n * specify this rule, 0 would be matched to the \"other\" category and \"0 people are viewing\"\n * would be shown instead of \"Nobody is viewing\". You can specify an explicit number rule for\n * other numbers, for example 12, so that instead of showing \"12 people are viewing\", you can\n * show \"a dozen people are viewing\".\n *\n * You can use a set of closed braces (`{}`) as a placeholder for the number that you want substituted\n * into pluralized strings. In the previous example, Angular will replace `{}` with\n * <span ng-non-bindable>`{{personCount}}`</span>. The closed braces `{}` is a placeholder\n * for <span ng-non-bindable>{{numberExpression}}</span>.\n *\n * If no rule is defined for a category, then an empty string is displayed and a warning is generated.\n * Note that some locales define more categories than `one` and `other`. For example, fr-fr defines `few` and `many`.\n *\n * # Configuring ngPluralize with offset\n * The `offset` attribute allows further customization of pluralized text, which can result in\n * a better user experience. For example, instead of the message \"4 people are viewing this document\",\n * you might display \"John, Kate and 2 others are viewing this document\".\n * The offset attribute allows you to offset a number by any desired value.\n * Let's take a look at an example:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ng-pluralize count=\"personCount\" offset=2\n *               when=\"{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',\n *                      '1': '{{person1}} is viewing.',\n *                      '2': '{{person1}} and {{person2}} are viewing.',\n *                      'one': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and one other person are viewing.',\n *                      'other': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and {} other people are viewing.'}\">\n * </ng-pluralize>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that we are still using two plural categories(one, other), but we added\n * three explicit number rules 0, 1 and 2.\n * When one person, perhaps John, views the document, \"John is viewing\" will be shown.\n * When three people view the document, no explicit number rule is found, so\n * an offset of 2 is taken off 3, and Angular uses 1 to decide the plural category.\n * In this case, plural category 'one' is matched and \"John, Mary and one other person are viewing\"\n * is shown.\n *\n * Note that when you specify offsets, you must provide explicit number rules for\n * numbers from 0 up to and including the offset. If you use an offset of 3, for example,\n * you must provide explicit number rules for 0, 1, 2 and 3. You must also provide plural strings for\n * plural categories \"one\" and \"other\".\n *\n * @param {string|expression} count The variable to be bound to.\n * @param {string} when The mapping between plural category to its corresponding strings.\n * @param {number=} offset Offset to deduct from the total number.\n *\n * @example\n    <example module=\"pluralizeExample\">\n      <file

Each template\n * instance gets its own scope, where the given loop variable is set to the current collection item,\n * and `$index` is set to the item index or key.\n *\n * Special properties are exposed on the local scope of each template instance, including:\n *\n * | Variable  | Type            | Details                                                                     |\n * |-----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n * | `$index`  | {@type number}  | iterator offset of the repeated element (0..length-1)                       |\n * | `$first`  | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is first in the iterator.                      |\n * | `$middle` | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is between the first and last in the iterator. |\n * | `$last`   | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is last in the iterator.                       |\n * | `$even`   | {@type boolean} | true if the iterator position `$index` is even (otherwise false).           |\n * | `$odd`    | {@type boolean} | true if the iterator position `$index` is odd (otherwise false).            |\n *\n * Creating aliases for these properties is possible with {@link ng.directive:ngInit `ngInit`}.\n * This may be useful when, for instance, nesting ngRepeats.\n *\n *\n * # Iterating over object properties\n *\n * It is possible to get `ngRepeat` to iterate over the properties of an object using the following\n * syntax:\n *\n * ```js\n * <div ng-repeat=\"(key, value) in myObj\"> ... </div>\n * ```\n *\n * You need to be aware that the JavaScript specification does not define the order of keys\n * returned for an object. (To mitigate this in Angular 1.3 the `ngRepeat` directive\n * used to sort the keys alphabetically.)\n *\n * Version 1.4 removed the alphabetic sorting. We now rely on the order returned by the browser\n * when running `for key in myObj`. It seems that browsers generally follow the strategy of providing\n * keys in the order in which they were defined, although there are exceptions when keys are deleted\n * and reinstated. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete#Cross-browser_issues\n *\n * If this is not desired, the recommended workaround is to convert your object into an array\n * that is sorted into the order that you prefer before providing it to `ngRepeat`.  You could\n * do this with a filter such as [toArrayFilter](http://ngmodules.org/modules/angular-toArrayFilter)\n * or implement a `$watch` on the object yourself.\n *\n *\n * # Tracking and Duplicates\n *\n * When the contents of the collection change, `ngRepeat` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n *\n * By default, `ngRepeat` does not allow duplicate items in arrays. This is because when\n * there are duplicates, it is not possible to maintain a one-to-one mapping between collection\n * items and DOM elements.\n *\n * If you do need to repeat duplicate items, you can substitute the default tracking behavior\n * with your own using the `track by` expression.\n *\n * For example, you may track items by the index of each item in the collection, using the\n * special scope property `$index`:\n * ```html\n *    <div ng-repeat=\"n in [42, 42, 43, 43] track by $index\">\n *      {{n}}\n *    </div>\n * ```\n *\n * You may use arbitrary expressions in `track by`, including references to custom functions\n * on the scope:\n * ```html\n *    <div ng-repeat=\"n in [42, 42, 43, 43] track by myTrackingFunction(n)\">\n *      {{n}}\n *    </div>\n * ```\n *\n * If you are working with objects that have an identifier property, you can track\n * by the identifier instead of the whole object. Should you reload your data later, `ngRepeat`\n * will not have to rebuild the DOM elements for items it has already rendered, even if the\n * JavaScript objects in the collection have been substituted for new ones:\n * ```html\n *    <div ng-repeat=\"model in collection track by model.id\">\n *      {{model.name}}\n *    </div>\n * ```\n *\n * When no `track by` expression is provided, it is equivalent to tracking by the built-in\n * `$id` function, which tracks items by their identity:\n * ```html\n *    <div ng-repeat=\"obj in collection track by $id(obj)\">\n *      {{obj.prop}}\n *    </div>\n * ```\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n * **Note:** `track by` must always be the last expression:\n * </div>\n * ```\n * <div ng-repeat=\"model in collection | orderBy: 'id' as filtered_result track by model.id\">\n *     {{model.name}}\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * # Special repeat start and end points\n * To repeat a series of elements instead of just one parent element, ngRepeat (as well as other ng directives) supports extending\n * the range of the repeater by defining explicit start and end points by using **ng-repeat-start** and **ng-repeat-end** respectively.\n * The **ng-repeat-start** directive works the same as **ng-repeat**, but will repeat all the HTML code (including the tag it's defined on)\n * up to and including the ending HTML tag where **ng-repeat-end** is placed.\n *\n * The example below makes use of this feature:\n * ```html\n *   <header ng-repeat-start=\"item in items\">\n *     Header {{ item }}\n *   </header>\n *   <div class=\"body\">\n *     Body {{ item }}\n *   </div>\n *   <footer ng-repeat-end>\n *     Footer {{ item }}\n *   </footer>\n * ```\n *\n * And with an input of {@type ['A','B']} for the items variable in the example above, the output will evaluate to:\n * ```html\n *   <header>\n *     Header A\n *   </header>\n *   <div class=\"body\">\n *     Body A\n *   </div>\n *   <footer>\n *     Footer A\n *   </footer>\n *   <header>\n *     Header B\n *   </header>\n *   <div class=\"body\">\n *     Body B\n *   </div>\n *   <footer>\n *     Footer B\n *   </footer>\n * ```\n *\n * The custom start and end points for ngRepeat also support all other HTML directive syntax flavors provided in AngularJS (such\n * as **data-ng-repeat-start**, **x-ng-repeat-start** and **ng:repeat-start**).\n *\n * @animations\n * **.enter** - when a new item is added to the list or when an item is revealed after a filter\n *\n * **.leave** - when an item is removed from the list or when an item is filtered out\n *\n * **.move** - when an adjacent item is filtered out causing a reorder or when the item contents are reordered\n *\n * @element ANY\n * @scope\n * @priority 1000\n * @param {repeat_expression} ngRepeat The expression indicating how to enumerate a collection. These\n *   formats are currently supported:\n *\n *   * `variable in expression` – where variable is the user defined loop variable and `expression`\n *     is a scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.\n *\n *     For example: `album in artist.albums`.\n *\n *   * `(key, value) in expression` – where `key` and `value` can be any user defined identifiers,\n *     and `expression` is the scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.\n *\n *     For example: `(name, age) in {'adam':10, 'amalie':12}`.\n *\n *   * `variable in expression track by tracking_expression` – You can also provide an optional tracking expression\n *     which can be used to associate the objects in the collection with the DOM elements. If no tracking expression\n *     is specified, ng-repeat associates elements by identity. It is an error to have\n *     more than one tracking expression value resolve to the same key. (This would mean that two distinct objects are\n *     mapped to the same DOM element, which is not possible.)\n *\n *     Note that the tracking expression must come last, after any filters, and the alias expression.\n *\n *     For example: `item in items` is equivalent to `item in items track by $id(item)`. This implies that the DOM elements\n *     will be associated by item identity in the array.\n *\n *     For example: `item in items track by $id(item)`. A built in `$id()` function can be used to assign a unique\n *     `$$hashKey` property to each item in the array. This property is then used as a key to associated DOM elements\n *     with the corresponding item in the array by identity. Moving the same object in array would move the DOM\n *     element in the same way in the DOM.\n *\n *     For example: `item in items track by item.id` is a typical pattern when the items come from the database. In this\n *     case the object identity does not matter. Two objects are considered equivalent as long as their `id`\n *     property is same.\n *\n *     For example: `item in items | filter:searchText track by item.id` is a pattern that might be used to apply a filter\n *     to items in conjunction with a tracking expression.\n *\n *   * `variable in expression as alias_expression` – You can also provide an optional alias expression which will then store the\n *     intermediate results of the repeater after the filters have been applied. Typically this is used to render a special message\n *     when a filter is active on the repeater, but the filtered result set is empty.\n *\n *     For example: `item in items | filter:x as results` will store the fragment of the repeated items as `results`, but only after\n *     the items have been processed through the filter.\n *\n *     Please note that `as [variable name] is not an operator but rather a part of ngRepeat micro-syntax so it can be used only at the end\n *     (and not as operator, inside an expression).\n *\n *     For example: `item in items | filter : x | orderBy : order | limitTo : limit as results` .\n *\n * @example\n * This example initializes the scope to a list of names and\n * then uses `ngRepeat` to display every person:\n  <example module=\"ngAnimate\" deps=\"angular-animate.js\" animations=\"true\">\n    <file name=\"index.html\">\n      <div ng-init=\"friends = [\n        {name:'John', age:25, gender:'boy'},\n        {name:'Jessie', age:30, gender:'girl'},\n        {name:'Johanna', age:28, gender:'girl'},\n        {name:'Joy', age:15, gender:'girl'},\n        {name:'Mary', age:28, gender:'girl'},\n        {name:'Peter', age:95, gender:'boy'},\n        {name:'Sebastian', age:50, gender:'boy'},\n        {name:'Erika', age:27, gender:'girl'},\n        {name:'Patrick', age:40, gender:'boy'},\n        {name:'Samantha', age:60, gender:'girl'}\n      ]\">\n        I have {{friends.length}} friends.

The element is shown or hidden by removing or adding\n * the `.ng-hide` CSS class onto the element. The `.ng-hide` CSS class is predefined\n * in AngularJS and sets the display style to none (using an !important flag).\n * For CSP mode please add `angular-csp.css` to your html file (see {@link ng.directive:ngCsp ngCsp}).\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- when $scope.myValue is truthy (element is visible) -->\n * <div ng-show=\"myValue\"></div>\n *\n * <!-- when $scope.myValue is falsy (element is hidden) -->\n * <div ng-show=\"myValue\" class=\"ng-hide\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * When the `ngShow` expression evaluates to a falsy value then the `.ng-hide` CSS class is added to the class\n * attribute on the element causing it to become hidden. When truthy, the `.ng-hide` CSS class is removed\n * from the element causing the element not to appear hidden.\n *\n * ## Why is !important used?\n *\n * You may be wondering why !important is used for the `.ng-hide` CSS class. This is because the `.ng-hide` selector\n * can be easily overridden by heavier selectors. For example, something as simple\n * as changing the display style on a HTML list item would make hidden elements appear visible.\n * This also becomes a bigger issue when dealing with CSS frameworks.\n *\n * By using !important, the show and hide behavior will work as expected despite any clash between CSS selector\n * specificity (when !important isn't used with any conflicting styles). If a developer chooses to override the\n * styling to change how to hide an element then it is just a matter of using !important in their own CSS code.\n *\n * ### Overriding `.ng-hide`\n *\n * By default, the `.ng-hide` class will style the element with `display: none!important`. If you wish to change\n * the hide behavior with ngShow/ngHide then this can be achieved by restating the styles for the `.ng-hide`\n * class CSS. Note that the selector that needs to be used is actually `.ng-hide:not(.ng-hide-animate)` to cope\n * with extra animation classes that can be added.\n *\n * ```css\n * .ng-hide:not(.ng-hide-animate) {\n *   /&#42; this is just another form of hiding an element &#42;/\n *   display: block!important;\n *   position: absolute;\n *   top: -9999px;\n *   left: -9999px;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * By default you don't need to override in CSS anything and the animations will work around the display style.\n *\n * ## A note about animations with `ngShow`\n *\n * Animations in ngShow/ngHide work with the show and hide events that are triggered when the directive expression\n * is true and false. This system works like the animation system present with ngClass except that\n * you must also include the !important flag to override the display property\n * so that you can perform an animation when the element is hidden during the time of the animation.\n *\n * ```css\n * //\n * //a working example can be found at the bottom of this page\n * //\n * .my-element.ng-hide-add, .my-element.ng-hide-remove {\n *   /&#42; this is required as of 1.3x to properly\n *      apply all styling in a show/hide animation &#42;/\n *   transition: 0s linear all;\n * }\n *\n * .my-element.ng-hide-add-active,\n * .my-element.ng-hide-remove-active {\n *   /&#42; the transition is defined in the active class &#42;/\n *   transition: 1s linear all;\n * }\n *\n * .my-element.ng-hide-add { ... }\n * .my-element.ng-hide-add.ng-hide-add-active { ... }\n * .my-element.ng-hide-remove { ... }\n * .my-element.ng-hide-remove.ng-hide-remove-active { ... }\n * ```\n *\n * Keep in mind that, as of AngularJS version 1.3.0-beta.11, there is no need to change the display\n * property to block during animation states--ngAnimate will handle the style toggling automatically for you.\n *\n * @animations\n * addClass: `.ng-hide` - happens after the `ngShow` expression evaluates to a truthy value and the just before contents are set to visible\n * removeClass: `.ng-hide` - happens after the `ngShow` expression evaluates to a non truthy value and just before the contents are set to hidden\n *\n * @element ANY\n * @param {expression} ngShow If the {@link guide/expression expression} is truthy\n *     then the element is shown or hidden respectively.\n *\n * @example\n  <example module=\"ngAnimate\" deps=\"angular-animate.js\" animations=\"true\">\n    <file name=\"index.html\">\n      Click me: <input type=\"checkbox\" ng-model=\"checked\" aria-label=\"Toggle ngHide\"><br/>\n      <div>\n        Show:\n        <div class=\"check-element animate-show\" ng-show=\"checked\">\n          <span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up\"></span> I show up when your checkbox is checked.\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        Hide:\n        <div class=\"check-element animate-show\" ng-hide=\"checked\">\n          <span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-down\"></span> I hide when your checkbox is checked.\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"glyphicons.css\">\n      @import url(../../components/bootstrap-3.1.1/css/bootstrap.css);\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"animations.css\">\n      .animate-show {\n        line-height: 20px;\n        opacity: 1;\n        padding: 10px;\n        border: 1px solid black;\n        background: white;\n      }\n\n      .animate-show.ng-hide-add.ng-hide-add-active,\n      .animate-show.ng-hide-remove.ng-hide-remove-active {\n        -webkit-transition: all linear 0.5s;\n        transition: all linear 0.5s;\n      }\n\n      .animate-show.ng-hide {\n        line-height: 0;\n        opacity: 0;\n        padding: 0 10px;\n      }\n\n      .check-element {\n        padding: 10px;\n        border: 1px solid black;\n        background: white;\n      }\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"protractor.js\" type=\"protractor\">\n      var thumbsUp = element(by.css('span.glyphicon-thumbs-up'));\n      var thumbsDown = element(by.css('span.glyphicon-thumbs-down'));\n\n      it('should check ng-show / ng-hide', function() {\n        expect(thumbsUp.isDisplayed()).toBeFalsy();\n        expect(thumbsDown.isDisplayed()).toBeTruthy();\n\n        element(by.model('checked')).click();\n\n        expect(thumbsUp.isDisplayed()).toBeTruthy();\n        expect(thumbsDown.isDisplayed()).toBeFalsy();\n      });\n    </file>\n  </example>\n */\nvar ngShowDirective = ['$animate', function($animate) {\n  return {\n    restrict: 'A',\n    multiElement: true,\n    link: function(scope, element, attr) {\n      scope.$watch(attr.ngShow, function ngShowWatchAction(value) {\n        // we're adding a temporary, animation-specific class for ng-hide since this way\n        // we can control when the element is actually displayed on screen without having\n        // to have a global/greedy CSS selector that breaks when other animations are run.\n        // Read: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/9103#issuecomment-58335845\n        $animate[value ?

The element is shown or hidden by removing or adding\n * the `ng-hide` CSS class onto the element. The `.ng-hide` CSS class is predefined\n * in AngularJS and sets the display style to none (using an !important flag).\n * For CSP mode please add `angular-csp.css` to your html file (see {@link ng.directive:ngCsp ngCsp}).\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- when $scope.myValue is truthy (element is hidden) -->\n * <div ng-hide=\"myValue\" class=\"ng-hide\"></div>\n *\n * <!-- when $scope.myValue is falsy (element is visible) -->\n * <div ng-hide=\"myValue\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * When the `ngHide` expression evaluates to a truthy value then the `.ng-hide` CSS class is added to the class\n * attribute on the element causing it to become hidden. When falsy, the `.ng-hide` CSS class is removed\n * from the element causing the element not to appear hidden.\n *\n * ## Why is !important used?\n *\n * You may be wondering why !important is used for the `.ng-hide` CSS class.

The second path segment will be captured as the parameter 'id'.\n * * `'/user/{id}'` - Same as the previous example, but using curly brace syntax.\n * * `'/user/{id:[^/]*}'` - Same as the previous example.\n * * `'/user/{id:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,8}}'` - Similar to the previous example, but only matches if the id\n *   parameter consists of 1 to 8 hex digits.\n * * `'/files/{path:.*}'` - Matches any URL starting with '/files/' and captures the rest of the\n *   path into the parameter 'path'.\n * * `'/files/*path'` - ditto.\n * * `'/calendar/{start:date}'` - Matches \"/calendar/2014-11-12\" (because the pattern defined\n *   in the built-in  `date` Type matches `2014-11-12`) and provides a Date object in $stateParams.start\n *\n * @param {string} pattern  The pattern to compile into a matcher.\n * @param {Object} config  A configuration object hash:\n * @param {Object=} parentMatcher Used to concatenate the pattern/config onto\n *   an existing UrlMatcher\n *\n * * `caseInsensitive` - `true` if URL matching should be case insensitive, otherwise `false`, the default value (for backward compatibility) is `false`.\n * * `strict` - `false` if matching against a URL with a trailing slash should be treated as equivalent to a URL without a trailing slash, the default value is `true`.\n *\n * @property {string} prefix  A static prefix of this pattern.

Even when you don't use the views object\n   *   explicitly on a state config, one is still created for you internally.\n   *   So by decorating this builder function you have access to decorating template\n   *   and controller properties.\n   * - **ownParams** `{object}` - returns an array of params that belong to the state,\n   *   not including any params defined by ancestor states.\n   * - **path** `{string}` - returns the full path from the root down to this state.\n   *   Needed for state activation.\n   * - **includes** `{object}` - returns an object that includes every state that\n   *   would pass a `$state.includes()` test.\n   *\n   * @example\n   * <pre>\n   * // Override the internal 'views' builder with a function that takes the state\n   * // definition, and a reference to the internal function being overridden:\n   * $stateProvider.decorator('views', function (state, parent) {\n   *   var result = {},\n   *       views = parent(state);\n   *\n   *   angular.forEach(views, function (config, name) {\n   *     var autoName = (state.name + '.' + name).replace('.', '/');\n   *     config.templateUrl = config.templateUrl || '/partials/' + autoName + '.html';\n   *     result[name] = config;\n   *   });\n   *   return result;\n   * });\n   *\n   * $stateProvider.state('home', {\n   *   views: {\n   *     'contact.list': { controller: 'ListController' },\n   *     'contact.item': { controller: 'ItemController' }\n   *   }\n   * });\n   *\n   * // ...\n   *\n   * $state.go('home');\n   * // Auto-populates list and item views with /partials/home/contact/placementsList.html,\n   * // and /partials/home/contact/item.html, respectively.\n   * </pre>\n   *\n   * @param {string} name The name of the builder function to decorate.\n   * @param {object} func A function that is responsible for decorating the original\n   * builder function.

Note: query parameter values\n   *     default to a special `\"auto\"` mode.\n   *\n   *     For query parameters in `\"auto\"` mode, if multiple  values for a single parameter\n   *     are present in the URL (e.g.: `/foo?bar=1&bar=2&bar=3`) then the values\n   *     are mapped to an array (e.g.: `{ foo: [ '1', '2', '3' ] }`).  However, if\n   *     only one value is present (e.g.: `/foo?bar=1`) then the value is treated as single\n   *     value (e.g.: `{ foo: '1' }`).\n   *\n   * <pre>params: {\n   *     param1: { array: true }\n   * }</pre>\n   *\n   *   - ** squash ** - {bool|string=}: `squash` configures how a default parameter value is represented in the URL when\n   *     the current parameter value is the same as the default value.

It is encoded and included in the URL\n   *     - true: The parameter's default value is omitted from the URL.  If the parameter is preceeded and followed\n   *       by slashes in the state's `url` declaration, then one of those slashes are omitted.\n   *       This can allow for cleaner looking URLs.\n   *     - `\"<arbitrary string>\"`: The parameter's default value is replaced with an arbitrary placeholder of  your choice.\n   *\n   * <pre>params: {\n   *     param1: {\n   *       value: \"defaultId\",\n   *       squash: true\n   * } }\n   * // squash \"defaultValue\" to \"~\"\n   * params: {\n   *     param1: {\n   *       value: \"defaultValue\",\n   *       squash: \"~\"\n   * } }\n   * </pre>\n   *\n   *\n   * @example\n   * <pre>\n   * // Some state name examples\n   *\n   * // stateName can be a single top-level name (must be unique).\n   * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {});\n   *\n   * // Or it can be a nested state name.
